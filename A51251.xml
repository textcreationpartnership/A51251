            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Now that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is the Vine, the True Vine,</hi> is for ſuch as they noe hard ſaying to underſtand, according to the letter, which is the ſence the words import; ſeeing the Scripture menciones two men or two Adams, the firſt man, who is the firſt Adam; and the ſecond man, who is the laſt Adam. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.45.47.

            <p n="6">VI. Hee is the vine, in and through whom al ſpirituall, and quickening ſap, and powre of the devine nature flowes, that brings forth good grapes, or fruites that are acceptable, that will either ſatisfie or be gathered of his Father, and him, <hi>Pſal</hi> 52.8. <hi>Hoſe.</hi> 14.5.8. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5.9. 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.12. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.1.14. and 5.1.</p>

            <p n="1">I. The naturall vines, the trees ſoe called, that bring forth ſuch fruites as aforeſaid, truth theſe vines, are vines endeed, as Creatures that have theire being, ſupport, fruitfulneſſe, and operation of their fruits from God through Chriſt. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.4.11. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 75.3. <hi>Coll.</hi> 1.17. Without whoſe word, or forth-putting of his bleſſing, thoſe vines languiſh, and bring forth noe fruite, or bringing forth fruits, yet cannot nouriſh, nor are accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with thoſe bleſſings of plenty peace, and ſafetie. <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.30.40. <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Ames.</hi> 4.9. <hi>Hag.</hi> 1.6. &amp; 16.17. Soe as theſe are but ſervants, inſtrumentall, and decayeing vines.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Ieſus Chriſt:</hi> even oppoſed to theſe is the <hi>True Vine,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven that which endureth for ever, hee in whom God dwells, and through whom God doth all, ſoe as by his word of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing men live, and the whole old, and decayeing creation is ſupported for its time. <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.3. In him we live move, &amp; have
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60076:4"/>our being, what ever fruite wee eate, or drink. <hi>Act.</hi> 17.28. Hee is our life, and the length of our dayes. <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.20. That ſo even that life that we live in the fleſh, and that part of it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that reſpecteth the bodie, and naturall life, wee might live it by faith of, and dependance on him, that hath loved us, and given himſelfe for us. <hi>Gall.</hi> 2.20. Who is the true, dureing, and fruitfull vine, the true vine eminently.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Adam, the firſt Adam; as the publick man, and roote out of which all men come, metaphorrically may be called a vine, being a figure of him to come, <hi>Rom:</hi> 5.14. And all his children branches, and their works, or fruites grapes, this in ſome ſort may appeare from that <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.18. And then Adam ſoe conſidered is appoluted and ecayed vine, in whom all ſinned, and fiell under condemnation, and death. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12.18.

            <p>But Ieſus Chriſt the ſecond man, the laſt Adam, the Lord; the quickening ſpirit; hee is the true vine, in that hee as the publick man hath for men, and in mans nature, in his owne perſon by death, reſurrection, and ſacrifice taken away ſin, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.5.

            <p>So that if we would have the preparation for life, God hath made receive the teſtimony of love he hath given, and receive his promiſes with which comes plenty, peace, and ſafetie, drink of the wine that cheareth both God, and man, have the ſpirit of life, &amp; be fruitfull in it; <hi>Abide in Chriſt:</hi> hee is the vine in which all this is, if wee would be freed from being ſnared with outward mercies from perriſhing in the

True it is, Ieſus Chriſt tooke the nature of mankind, of al men, al that come of Adam, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.24. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. And in that nature hath dyed, and riſen, and is glorified, and filled with life, and Spirit for men, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.24. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.18. But this nature of Adam or man, Chriſt tooke of man, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Gall.</hi> 4.4. Not wee of him this frayle nature, but hee of us tooke this, whence hee is called; the ſon of man, of Adam. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.14. <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.56. and 3.38. And though in himſelf he hath reſtored, and glorified this nature for us, yet our comming in to him to partake with him is by the Spirit, or powre of the devine nature that is in him, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30.</p>
            <p>And ſo al men by nature, and firſt birth be Adams ſons, and as the Gentils in opoſition to the Iewes were of the wild Olive tree, ſoe al men comming from Adam, and remaining in their natural ſtate, opoſed to Chriſt, and thoſe born of him be of the corrupt, and pohited vine, dead in treſpaſſes, and ſius. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.1.2.3. Yea even the Jewes themſelves, though bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60076:5"/>of the true-olive: and tipicall vine; yet in reſpect of ſpiritual one neſſe in, and with Chriſt, they by firſt birth are not branches in him, but children of the fleſh, dead in ſinnes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9. And need a new birth to bring them into Chriſt, that they may be branches in him. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.3.5.</p>
            <p>Soe that noe man by his firſt birth is a branch in this vine nor any, but ſuch as are in ſome ſort born againe; ſoe that though Chriſt hath for all men taken their nature, and reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it, yet al men are not in him, and ſo receive not that reſtoration.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we have to note, that; theſe ſpoken too, <hi>now were, but alwayes had not beene branches in this True Vine;</hi> They were by nature dead in ſins and treſpaſtes once, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.1.2.3.4.5.

Soe that in this, that they were now branches in this vine; wee have fowre things conſiderable; I. How they came to bee branches in Chriſt the true-vine. II. In what ſence they are ſaid to be in him. III. What degrees are conſiderable about beeing in Chriſt, as branches in the vine. IV. What is intimated by their beeing in Chriſt, as branches in the vine, and all this as Scripture ſheweth, ſpeakeing of ſuch things, apeares to bee: That</p>
            <p n="1">I. Their becomming to be branches in this vine was not by, and according to nature, and naturall meanes; for Jeſus Chriſt is a ſpiritual man, the Lord from heaven heavenly, and ſoe in that not like the firſt Adam, who was a natural man, and had his poſterity in his loynes, to come forth of him by a natural generation, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15, 45, 47. <hi>Gen.</hi> 5, 2, 3, 4. But as the Lord Chriſt is a ſpiritual man, ſo his ſeed is a ſpirituall ſeed, not naturally ſpringing forth from him, but ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, and ſpiritually by a new birth from above: brought in to him, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3, 3, 5. and 6, 44, 45. Soe as none are branches in Chriſt, but ſuch as were branches of the firſt, and fallen Adam firſt, <hi>Pro.</hi> 8, 31, 32. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1, 4. Whence that thinks for ſome, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6, 17. Soe as for comming to bee branches in Chriſt, there muſt be a ſetting forth of Chriſt, to the naturall branches of Adam to bee believed in. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24, 25, 26. And therein a takeing out of the old Adam, and ingraſting into Chriſt the new; like that, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11, 17. And this is eſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted as the new birth, (beeing the ſame with it) by water, and Spirit, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3, 5. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44, 3, 4, 5. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36, 24, 27. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5, 6.</p>
            <pb n="10" facs="tcp:60076:6"/>
            <p n="1">I. By water; (which ſpiritually underſtood is) the free love of God in the gift of his ſon, &amp; commended through his ſon, as ſet forth, and declared in the Goſpell or word of grace; with ſuch preſence of ſpirit as makes it diſcernable, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32, 1.2.3.4. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.5.14.15.16. 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.6.7.8. Which ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes how Chriſt was broken, and opened for us, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53; What God hath done, and prepared for us in him, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19; And ſo evidenceth the love of God to call, and draw us to him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.8.10. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.4.5. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.10; And ſo are they begot to him by the word, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 4. <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.18.</p>
            <p n="2">II. By the holy ſpirit of Chriſt or power of the devine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, entering the word into the hart, ſo giving light, and glorifying Chriſt to the hart, and Gods love through him, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.130. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.26. &amp; 16.14.15. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. So as he therby breakes of all old Adam like confidences, and in ſome meaſure enables to believe in Chriſt, and ſo brings into him, enableing them to receive the teſtimonie, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.3.7.8.9. <hi>Act</hi> 11.20.21. 1. <hi>Theſs.</hi> 1.5.2. <hi>Theſs.</hi> 1.10; So as they begin to rely on God in Chriſt. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.22, 25. And to love Chriſt &amp; his 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8.21.22.23; And ſo come in to him to attend on him for teaching, and life, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.67.68.69. In which teaching of his by his ſpirit, they ar united in hart; or ſpirit to him, and renewed, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5.6.7. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.17.18.</p>
            <p>And ſo were theſe borne againe, and brought into Chriſt and made branches in him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16, 16. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.14.17. &amp; 15.14.16.19.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The ſence in which they are ſayde to be branches in him is likewiſe ſpiritual, ſuitable to the ſpiritual man, and ſo not to be underſtood of a carnal union, or in beeing, but of a ſpiritual union and in being in Chriſt, the joyneing is by ſpirit, and union ſpiritual one ſpirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6 17; And ſo as hee is in the believers ſpiritually and by ſpirit, and ſpiritual oppe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rationes, viz.</p>

            <p n="1">I. By faith, or the ſpirit of faith, in receite of the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye comming in to him, cloſeing with him, and relyeing on him by believeing in him, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.10.13. <hi>Gall.</hi> 3.26 29. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.12.13; And ſo in him by faith.</p>
            <p n="2">II. By love ſpringing from his love ſhead abroad in their hart by the holy ſpirit, by which they love him, and God in him; and him at the right hand of God, and him in his ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual preſence in his people, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5. 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4 19 20.21. and 5 1. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8 22, And ſo they cleave to him, and are in him By love, deſires, delight, and well-pleaſedneſſe in him, <hi>Call.</hi> 3.1.2.11. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.22. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.21.23 and 16.27. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.25.</p>
            <p n="3">III. By a ſweet, and harty ſubmiſſion to be under his teac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hings, and in fellowſhip with him, and his people, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.24. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.68.69. <hi>Gall.</hi> 2.20.</p>
            <p>And thus were they in Chriſt by faith, and love, and delight in him, and ſubmiſſion to his teachings, in ſpiritual fellowſhip with him, and his people in his ordinances, <hi>Pro.</hi> 8.34.35. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.1.4.5; And thus were they branches in this ſpiritual, and True Vine.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. The degrees conſiderable about being in Chriſt: as branches in the vine are threefold, I. Preparing, and drawing to him, II. Eſtabliſhing, and firmeing in him, III. Farther roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedneſſe in knowne, and growne eſtabliſhment and fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
            <p n="1">I. In Some ſence, or degree, or preparation, and drawing to a nighneſſe with Chriſt into the outward court of his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and under his ſhadow, and teachings, into fellowſhip with his people, in his ordinances; to beare his name, and ſoe into the way in which waiteing they ſhall be faſtened in him, as that <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.5.8. and <hi>Hoſe.</hi> 1, 1, 3.4; And this is when in the heavenly call, or in the declaration of the Goſpell, ſoe much light; and powre of the ſpirit goeth forth, that they are brought to diſerne, and believe the truth of the report, <hi>Gall.</hi> 3 1; So far as to admire the excellencies of Chriſt, and his doctrine, <hi>Gall</hi> 4.14; To deſire after him, <hi>Ioh</hi> 6.34 To yeeld to be his diſciples, to attend among his people in his ordinances and to make profeſſion of his name; ſoe far thoſe of whom Paule was yet afraid, <hi>Gall</hi> 4.11; Yea ſo far thoſe, 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.19. Yea ſoe far Iudas, and Simon Magus, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.13.</p>
            <pb n="12" facs="tcp:60076:7"/>
            <p>But yet theſe are not ſo prevailed with by the grace exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as to yeild up ſoe far to its opperationes, as to deny them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and let al their owne intereſts goe for Chriſt; and ſoe to be drawne out from the love and fellowſhip of the world; in the eſtimate of, reliance one, and deſire of retaining the repute, and advantages of humane wiſdome righteouſneſſe, honour, riches, &amp;c. &amp; to have all their delighs &amp; ſatisfying in Chriſt, who is not yet formed in them, nor they yet come to keep ſabboth in him; <hi>Gall.</hi> 4.9.19. <hi>Heb</hi> 4.1.4; Theſe alſo are of thoſe that are called, but not yet choſen, and ſoe though with ſuch choſen ones, as, 1. <hi>Pet</hi> 2.9; Yet not of them, 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.19. Though while they abide, they are reckoned brethren, and together with the reſt branches in the vine, and in abiding, there is hope fulneſſe, that they in due ſeaſon, ſhall be ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and firmed; <hi>Gall,</hi> 4, 7, 11, 12, 13, and 5.4.10. Yet of theſe their be two ſorts one ſort, that are humbled, and gained through the grace believed, to take heed to the word, as to a light ſhineing in a dark place, 2, <hi>Pet.</hi> 1, 19. And in waiteing to yeild themſelves to obey the doctrine, and grace of Chriſt and of theſe little feare, but great hope, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3, 7, 14. 2, <hi>Ioh,</hi> 9. The other ſort ſuch as doe ſecretly allow themſelves to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie ſome pardominat luſt, of coveteouſnes, pride, &amp;c. and as Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das and Simon Magus, and of ſuch, though while abideing, ſome hope they may be prevailed with yet its but ſmal and doubtfull, and the feare great, 1, <hi>Ioh,</hi> 2.19. Whence that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, <hi>Iud,</hi> 22, 23, And that exortation to one of theſe lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Act,</hi> 8, 22, 23.</p>
            <p n="2">II. There is a farther degree, when through the grace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in the heavenly call, they are pervailed with, to ſuffer the loſſe of all for Chriſt and by the powre of the grace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, enablied to take ſatisfying in Chriſt and hartily to reſt on god in Chriſt for eternall life, and all that apertaines ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too, and ſoe given up to be the Lords, <hi>Act,</hi> 26, 18, <hi>Rom,</hi> 4, 23, 25. And heerin receiveing in believeing remiſſion of ſins, and the ſpirit of adoption, to inhabit, comfort, and lead them, <hi>Rom,</hi> 5, 1, 5. and 8, 2, 14, 15. They are ſoe knit to Chriſt, and to his choſen ones, that their delight is in him, and fellowſhip with him; and them; ſo as they cannot depart from him, <hi>Ioh,</hi> 6, 68, 69, <hi>Ioh,</hi> 1, 2, 3, 4, and 2, 19, 20. <hi>Pſal,</hi> 16, 1, 2, &amp;c. And thus are they by grace choſen out of the world; the ſtate, love, and fellowſhip of the world, into Chriſt and love, and fellowſhip with him, and his, <hi>Ioh,</hi> 15, 16, 19, 1, <hi>Pet,</hi> 2, 9. And ſoe though
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60076:7"/>weakneſſe be found in them, and they may yet be wanting in the fulneſſe of joye, in reſpect of cleare knowledge and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of their eſtabliſhment, yet are they not of the world but in a ſtable condition, and ſuch as ſhall never be forſaken, <hi>Heb,</hi> 8, <hi>Ier,</hi> 31; And thus were theſe ſpoken too branches in the vine, in Chriſt the True Vine.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Yet is there a farther degree of rootedneſſe, and growth in oneneſſe in this vine, ſuch as was prayed for theſe that were already one in him, <hi>Ioh,</hi> 17, 20, 21; Which is in a more abundant, and bright diſcoverie of the excellencies of Chriſt in the hope of his call and glorious riches of his inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance in the ſaints, and the powre of the reſurrection, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veing more full teſtimony, and knowledge of eſtabliſhment and ſoe full aſſurance, more conforming to Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.14.17.20. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16.17.32.33. &amp;c. Which theſe alſo had after Chriſt his aſſencion, and giveing of the Holy Ghoſt, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. and 4.6.</p>
            <p>To thoſe of the firſt degree is hopefulneſſe in abiding; and the greatneſſe of the danger mencioned in unfruitfulneſſe, and departure to thoſe of the ſecond degree ſafety, though not alwayes the knowledge, comfort, and uſefulneſſe of it, and to loſſe of much may they come by unfruitfulneſſe, and want of conſtancy in abideing, in drincking in, and yeilding to the opperationes off his grace.</p>

            <p n="4">IV. The aſſured comfortable iſſue of all, namely: That in his word abiding in them, and they abiding in him, and ſo bringing forth fruites, their mayn deſighne, and buyſineſſe,

            <p>And our ſaviour having thus already inſtructed admoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and encouraged his diſciples, proceedeth in the, 9. and 10. <hi>Verſes.</hi> To a father encouragement direction and inſtruction of them to this <hi>Abiding that their joy might be full.</hi> From which practiſe of our ſaviour might be obſerved.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>That the work of the miniſtration of the Goſpell is a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al worke to be followed,</hi> not only for bringing in men ſtill to Chriſt, but even alſo for building up, and encouraging thoſe that are in Chriſt while they are in theſe clay tabernacles, ſo was the miniſtration of the Goſpel by Ieſus Chriſt from the beginning of it, from the baptiſme of Iohn, till the day that he left the world, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.21.22. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16.28. and 17.4.12.13. And ſo was the miniſtration of his ſervant till the time of their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.6.7.8. 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.13.14. And ſuch is the miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his ſervants ſtill to be a continued worke, and that not only that they may continue being the ſalt of the earth, and the light of the world, and by their light ſhining to win in men to glorify God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.13.16. But olſo for ſuch as God hath bleſſed their miniſtration unto, and made them inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpirit hath brought them to Chriſt enabled them to believe on him, and writ his mind in their hart, they are not then to ceaſe their miniſtration towards them, but then to follow one, and more abundantly to care for watch over, pray for, inſtruct, admoniſh, and encourage them for their father building up, and preſervation in the faith, and provocation to love, and good works, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.2. to 17. and 11.2.3. <hi>Iud.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28.</p>
            <p n="2">II. That thoſe, who are through grace brought into be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and ſo made cleane by the word of Chriſt applied to them, and ſo in Chriſt and hee in them it is meete, needful, profitable, and ſafe for them, to be ſtill attending the miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt in the Goſpell, and to be further inſtructed, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed;
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60076:12"/>exhorted, and encouraged, and that againe, and againe, while they are in theſe clay tabernacles, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.10.12. Yea though they bee ſinceere, and fruitfull, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.7. and 2.1.13. and 3.1.2.10. And know, and are eſtabliſhed in the preſent truth, 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12.13. Yea though their faith, love, and hope be ſtedfaſt, and opperative, and their election of God ſo teſtified as may be knowne. 1. <hi>Theſs.</hi> 1.3.5. and 3.2. Yet ſtil the miniſtration of the Goſpell is meete, needful, and ſafe even for them, becauſe of oppoſitiones in fleſh, and weakneſſe, (and wants that yet may yet be found in the uſefulneſſe) of their faith, and love, and orderly walking, 1. <hi>Theſs.</hi> 3.2.3.10.</p>
            <p>And good ends, and reaſons for both theſe points are given in the ſcripture it ſelf, as to inſtance briefly a fewe.</p>
            <p n="1">I. To ſtit up, and keepe mindfull, and waking the harts of the believers, 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.13. and 3.1. That ſo they may not ſuffer that loſe in opportunities which forgetfulneſſe, &amp; ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe endangers too, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.2.3.6.</p>
            <p n="2">II. To prevent, and ſave from ſeducements by falſe doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, which enſtrange from God, and Chriſt, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. to the end. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.1.2.3.11. 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.19.</p>
            <p n="3">III. To prevent, and ſave from the intiſements, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulneſſe of ſinfull, and worldly luſts that withdraw from God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.1.12.13. 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.16.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. To edify in faith, love, &amp; hope, 1 <hi>Theſs.</hi> 5.11. <hi>Iud.</hi> 20.21.22.</p>
            <p n="5">V. To provoke to fruitfulneſſe in love, and good works, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.24.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. To help forward to fulneſſe of joye, and comfort that may abide and hold in times of tribulation, 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.4. 1. <hi>Theſs.</hi> 3.2.3.</p>
            <p>So that in the truth of theſe two obſervationes, in Chriſt, practiſe, and teaching it appeares, that it comes not from the ſpirit of Chriſt for any diſpenſour of the Goſpell, to think, that when any are by their miniſtration brought to Chriſt that they may then leave their care over them, and ceaſe their miniſtration towards them, all the ſcriptures of the Apoſtles ſhew the contrarie. Nor is it from the ſpirit of Chriſt for any that in believing know themſelves in Chriſt, and hee in them to conceite, they now need no more to attend the miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Goſpell, the whole ſcripture ſheweth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, and this might alſo be an exhortation to us, both to the uſe of, and attendance to the continual miniſtration of the Goſpell, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.7.8, &amp;c. Now in the 9. and 10.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60076:13"/>
               <hi>Verſes:</hi> For the better, and more full underſtanding of that which is therein held forth to us, it is meete firſt to conſider ſome circumſtances about the words, and then that which is ſet forth in the words themſelves.</p>
            <p>Firſt: For the Circumſtances, theſe three are conſiderable.</p>
            <p>I. Who it is, that aſſirmeth ſoe great Love. II. To; and off whom ſo great love is affirmed. III. To what end the ſaying is recorded.</p>
            <p n="1">I. For the firſt, whoſe affirmation this is of ſo great, and peculiar love; It is evident from the chapters before, and <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. of this chapter, that it is the affirmation of Ieſus Chriſt, who is the Son of God. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.27. And the Saviour of the world. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.42. 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.14. And head, and husband of his Church. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.25.32. Who is the truth it ſelfe, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.6. All whoſe words are truth, and nothing falſe, or wreathed in them, <hi>Pro.</hi> 8.7, 8. Hee of whom the Father hath born teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.37. He of, and to whom the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of truth, hath bo ne, and doth beare teſtimony, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.26. 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.6. Hee whoſe lips are full of grace, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.2. And in whoſe mouth was never any guile found, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.22. So that of the truth, and verity of this affirmation, how great ſoever it were great ſin to doubt at all, and needfull it is, that wee be firme in beliefe of this greatneſſe, power love, and truth of our ſaviour his one-neſſe with God, and his one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe with us, his love to mankind, and his peculiar love to the church, that ſo wee may firmely believe the truth of this affirmation of ſo great love, &amp;c. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.31.32.33. and 11.25.</p>
            <p n="2">II. For the ſecond, who they are to, and of whom ſo great, and peculiar love is affirmed, and invitation, and direction for abiding therein given it is evident to be the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Chriſt: <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13. And though they were the eleven Apoſtles, Iudas Iſcariot being gone out, and their could be no more at that time, becauſe it would have beene above a competent number for eating the paſſeover together, yet this affirmation was to them, as they were his diſciples, and did beleeve on him, and love him, and ſo concerned all that did believe on him, and love him, as well as it did themſelves that were preſent to heare, and this appeares by the tearmes, and titles, by which they were called, as, His owne which were in the world, Ch. 13.1. Which alſo were al given, and brought to him by the heavenly call, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.39.44.45. and 17.2.8. And diſciples, Ch. 13.5.22.35. As all were that did believe on
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60076:13"/>him, and love him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.1.13.14.15.16. And little children, chap. 13.33. appliable to all that believe on him, and love him, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.1. 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.12.13. And it appeares likewiſe by the new commandment given them, chap. 13.34. Which is given to all that unfeinedly believe on him, 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.23.24. and 4.21. And it alſo appeares by the promiſe of the ſpirit to them, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.16.17. Which promiſe belongs alſo to all that believe on him, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7.38.39. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38.39. And it appeares alſo by the metaphor, and expreſſiones uſed in this 15. chap. In which al that it ſaid of being Branches in him, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 2.4.5. Of being cleane through the redemption, and propitiation in him, by his preaching the Goſpell ſpiritually applied to them, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 3. <hi>Of abiding in him, Verſ.</hi> 4. Of impoſſibillity of bringing forth any ſpirituall, and acceptable fruite, without abiding in him, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 4.5. Of the withering of ſuch as abide not in him <hi>Verſ.</hi> 6. Of the acceptation, and anſwering the prayers of ſuch as abide in him, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 7. Of the glorifying God by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth much fruite by thoſe that abide in him and his word<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 2.7.8. Every of which, and all of them applya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to every believer, <hi>Hoſe.</hi> 14.5.8. And nothing in all that is ſpoken which is ſo peculiar to the Apoſtles, But that it appertaines alſo to all believers, yea, and to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles themſelves, rather as they were believers, then as they were Apoſtles, like that, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.16.17.18. So that the affirmation of this ſo great love, is to, and of his diſciples, that did believe on him and love him, in whom wee have for our better underſtanding, and uſe-fulneſſe two things to be noted, one that they were endeed, belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in, and lovers of him, the other, that at that time, they were but babes, and cumbered with many infirmities.</p>
            <p n="1">I. They were ſuch as by the ſpirit of grace enlightening the Goſpell, or word of grace to their haat, were brought to believe in Ieſus Chriſt and in that believing to love him, and ſo were alſo beloved of the Father. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.16.17. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16.27. They were not ſuch as did challenge an intereſt in him, and his grace from any changes, or righteous works or frames of their owne, like the old Phariſees, <hi>Luk</hi> 18.9, 11. Or new followers of them that by ſuch changes; and works truſted in themſelves that they were Chriſts, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.7.12.18. Nor were they ſuch as were brought to believe only through an ignorant admiration, and good perſwaſion of Chriſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by ſome reports, and ſight of ſome great, rare, and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60076:14"/>wonderful works done by Chriſt as Nichodemus before he was borne againe, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.2.3.5. Nor were they ſuch as were brought to believe his doctrine, and admire him only through the beholding ſome excellency in his doctrine, and the heavenly, powerfull, and majeſticall manner of his teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as thoſe who were yet far from being borne againe, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7.46. and 8.30. Nor gained only to ſome fleeting deſires after good from him, as thoſe, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.28.34. Who yet tooke offence at his doctrine, but they were ſuch as were brought to this their believing.</p>
            <p n="1">I. By a ſpirituall illumination, revelation, or ſecret ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall evidence and teſtimony given by God, through the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell to their harts, evidencing to them and enlightening them in the great love of God in the gift of his ſon, and in the fulneſſe of grace and truth in Ieſus Chriſt and that hee is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Chriſt the ſon of the living God, the ſaviour of the world, who hath made the atonement, and in whom is life, in which diſcovery, and evidence, their harts were drawne to him, and enabled to believe on him, and love him, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.14.15.16. and 14 1. 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.14. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.16.17. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.4.5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1.11. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21.22.</p>
            <p n="2">II. By a ſpiritual communication, and infuſion of grace by Chriſt into their hart, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.4.5.6.7. Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing his father, and his fathers love to them and ſo giving in his fathers words, or the Goſpell he received to miniſter into their harts, in receite whereof they experimented love, and found life even eternall life, and were thereby knit both in love, and conſidence to him, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.6.8. and 1.16. and 6.68.69. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21.22. and 2.3.4.5. Thus through the Goſpell with ſpiritual illumination, and communication of grace, they did both believe in Ieſus Chriſt, and love him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feinedly: And ſuch they were.</p>
            <p n="2">II. They were ſuch as (notwithſtanding this their faith in Chriſt, and love of him) were yet but babes, and ſubject to like infirmities, as we now are, and that not only ſo far as thoſe, who were farther grown, then theſe yet were. <hi>Act.</hi> 14.14.15. <hi>Iam.</hi> 5.17. But as then weaker, and more lyable to bee foyled with infirmities, and paſſiones in ſome meaſure; then ſuch grown men were.</p>

Nor did yet underſtand the ſcriptures that ſpake of the ſufferings, reſurrection, and Kingdome of Chriſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.25.26.27.</p>
            <p n="2">II. They were as yet when this love was affirmed to them; but babes, and weake, in reſpect of the rule, and oppe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of grace, and their content taking therein, and being formed to the likenſſe of Chriſt thereby, being at ſome time ready to diſlike, and take offence, at their maſters plaine ſpeaking of his croſſe, and ſufferings, and to fault him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.21.23. <hi>Mar.</hi> 8.3.32. Some times ready to wiſh vengeance on ſuch as dealt diſcourteouſly with their maſter, and them, <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.53.56. One ſome occaſion ready to envie one another, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.20.24.25. Sometimes to envie ſuch as wrought mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles in the name of Chriſt, and did not follow them and to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid them, <hi>Mar.</hi> 9.38.39. Sometimes to he ſtriving, and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing who ſhould be the greateſt among them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.1.3. <hi>Mar.</hi> 9.33.34.</p>
            <p n="3">III. They were as yet but babes, and weake for ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſtrength for ſtanding, and walking, either in approving things moſt excellent, or giving excellent teſtimonies of love when tried, being ſometimes ready to misjudge of, and take offence at the excellent works, and fruites of love, both in leſus Chriſt their Lord, and maſter, <hi>Mar.</hi> 3.20.21. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13.8. And in ſuch as greatly loved him, <hi>Mat</hi> 26.8.16. And at one time of trial not able to watch with him one howre. <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.37.40.41. And againe in trial ready to withdraw though not from their faith, and love; yet from the walking in, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement, and teſtifying of their faith and love, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.56.70. Theſe, and ſuch like infirmities were they yet acumbred with which when they were better growne, they were more freed from, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.8.12. and 5.29.41. Though in ſome tryals, liable to be overtaken with ſome infirmities ſtill, <hi>Gall</hi> 2.11.12.</p>
            <p>So that they were believers, and as yet but wake believers ſuch as were yet ſubject to many infirmities, and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding thoſe infirmities, were unfeyned believers, and lovers of Chriſt to whom our ſaviour did affirme ſo great love, with invitation, and direction <hi>to continue in that his love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the third, to what end, and for what uſe this affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60076:15"/>invitation, charge, direction with promiſe of ſuch pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liat love is written and lift upon record to be read, preached, heard, meditated, and this appeares to bee.</p>
            <p n="1">I. More Generall, and common for all that come to heare, or reade the ſame, that in hearing, and reading they might believe the truth of this ſo great, and peculiar love of Chriſt to thoſe that are come into him, and believe on him, and love him, that in beliefe thereof they might deſire after him, and come in, and ſubmit to him, and receive his gracious words, that they alſo might there-through be brought to believe on him, and love him, that ſo they might come to partake of this peculiar love, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 11.42. and 17.21.22.23. and 20.31. As Ieſus Chriſt ſet forth the privilledges of his diſciples, in the hearing of the multitude, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.3.8. That the multitude hearing the ſame might bee alured to become his diſciples, that ſo they might alſo come to partake of ſuch priviledges.</p>
            <p n="2">II. More ſpeciall, and peculiar, for ſuch as by the ſpirit of grace are enabled through the Goſpell in the knowledge of the propitiation made by Chriſt and the eternall life that is in him, and the love of God in the gift of his ſon, to believe the truth, and goodneſſe of the report of the Goſpell ſo as there through they are convinced, and emptied of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer delight, and conſidences, and alured, and overcome to ſubmit, and come into Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.17. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.4.5. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.44.45. And in believing receive from God through Chriſt: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins, peace in conſcience, and acceſſe to God. <hi>Act.</hi> 10.43. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1.2. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.17.18. So as heerby they are enabled to believe, both the redemption, and reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation wrought in and by Chriſt with God, which is in him, and hee is, and that reconciliation that by his ſpirit he wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in men to God, and the eternall life that is in him to beſtow, and in this believing to depend on him for the ſame, and in that dependance, to love both him, and their brethren, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.6.7.8.11. and 4.22.25. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8.21.22.23. Theſe though yet accumbred with ſuch like infirmities, as theſe diſciples were, are yet true believers in, end lovers of Chriſt and built upon him, and in the ſame condition, and ſo loved, even as they were, as is evident by comparing our ſaviours profeſſion to Peter, and Peters aplication of the ſame to all unfeyned believers, and lovers of Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.16.17.18. With 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.3.4.5.9. And our ſaviours promiſe to all ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60076:15"/>in, and loving of him, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.21.23. And this affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, charge, and direction is recorded for their learning, that through patience, and comfort of the ſcriptures, they may have hope, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.4. And ſo not only know; they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, but even ſo beloved of Ieſus Chriſt, even as the Apoſtle writ to thoſe that believed, and knew they had life, that they might farther know this eternall life, and their having of it, and ſo believe more, and more, and have their joy full, 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.10.11.12.13. and 1.4. with <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.11.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> It ſeemes as if believers now could not have like aſſurance of ſuch peculiar love, and ſo ſuch conſolation in it, as the e had to whom Chriſt ſpake it, becauſe they had it from Chriſt his owne mouth, which none now can have becauſe he is in heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is a great miſtake and wrong conception, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed by our ſaviour himſelf, who before he lift the world did teſtifie, that he would ſend another advocate, and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, even the Holy Spirit of truth in his ſtead, and place to be with the believers for ever, and that his Spirit ſhould bring his words to their remembrance, and teach them al things. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.16.17.18.21.23.26. Yea ſoe as it ſhould be noe dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to them, that he left the world, and went to his Father, but more gainfull to them, then if he had not gone in bodily preſence from them. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.7.8.15. And this Holy Spirit gives to believers a twofold knowledge of this peculiar love, though not both alwayes at once; and this he doth.</p>
            <p n="1">I. By making a man a believer, glorifying Chriſt ſo in his hart, as hee not only brings him to believe the propitiation made by him, but in believing that love, and goodneſſe to depend on God in Chriſt, for farther ſaving, and for that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life that is in him, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24, 25. and 4.23; 25. and 5.8, 9, 11. And therein effects love, and a Chriſt-like di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſition, 2, <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3. In which believing, he gives them inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in Chriſt, and in al that is Chriſt, 1, <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. and 3.22, 23. And ſuch in their believing veiw of this affimation, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation, may know themſelves ſo beloved, and envited of Chriſt, and have the ſame aſſurance, and conſolation thereof that theſe had to whom Chriſt ſpake. If not ſomthing more then they had till after his aſſencion, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the promiſe of the more abundant portion of the Holy Ghoſt compare, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.4.5. 1, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.10.13. with <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.7, 15. and 30.31.</p>
            <pb n="30" facs="tcp:60076:16"/>
            <p n="2">II. By a more peculiar witneſſing ſuch love as this into their believing hart. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15, 16, 17. By a ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall illumination, and inſpiration of his gracious word, and promiſe into the hart, in which hee cleares up, and ſheads abroad, even this peculiar love more abundantly therein, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.26. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5, 6. By which Spirit Chriſt doth manifeſt his preſence with them, &amp; acquaint them with the things of the Father, and himſelfe, which gives more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant conſolation to the beleevers, as it did to theſe, when they received the ſame, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.21, 23. and 16, 13, 14, 15.7. <hi>Act.</hi> 2. <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.2.</p>
            <p>And to this end was this recorded, that believers might know certainly their intereſt in this peculiar love, and have the conſolation of it, &amp; waite therein for the more full, &amp; pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar teſtimony therof; &amp; ſo great their conſolation thereby.</p>
            <p>From theſe three things thus obſerved. (Viz.) That it is Jeſus Chriſt, that hath affirmed ſo great love, &amp;c. And that it was affirmed to believers, and that it is recorded for belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, that they may know how they are beloved.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Al that reade, and heare the ſame ſhould be ſtirred up, to obey, and embrace the Goſpell of Chriſt, in which not only deliverance from ſin and death is declared, and tendered, but alſo for ſuch as doe believe; ſuch peculiar love, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, to be farther found in Chriſt, and the greater grace it tenders, the greater the ſin, and the more woful the condition of al that doe ſlight, and diſobey the cal thereof. <hi>Act.</hi> 8.38.39.41. <hi>Hoſe.</hi> 11, 7. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.3. and 12.25. 2, <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1, 8. Oh that men would believe, and turne.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Believers have good cauſe to praiſe, and glorify God for recording the affirmationes of, and invitationes to ſuch grace in the Goſpell. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.16, 17. And alſo, to give the more erneſt heed to this great love, and to the invitation, and direction for continuance therein; ſeeing it is from Chriſt to them: <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.1, 4. And according to this threefold conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration vew the words themſelves, now in the words them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are three things conſiderable.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Our Saviour ſerious affirmation of his love, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of it to his diſciples, <hi>As the Father hath loved me, ſoe have I loved you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. His gracious exortation, invitation, or charge, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue yee in my love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. His ſweet, and ſafe direction how to continue in his
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60076:16"/>love, including a promiſe in it; <hi>If yee keepe my commandments, yee ſhall abide in my love, even as I have kept my Fathers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and abide in his love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. The firſt thing to be vewed in our Saviour ſerious affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As the Father hath loved mee, ſo have I loved you.</hi> In which are two thingss obſervable; One that our Saviour loveth his diſciples, that believe on him, and love him; and this put downe incluſively, as a thing ſo known to them, that it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no affirmation; The other: that our Saviour ſoe loves them, as the Father loves him, ſo that heere are two things affirmed. I. Chriſt his love to believers. II. The peculia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and manner of his love to them, whence ſpring two obſervation to veiw.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſ.</hi> 1. That Ieſus Chriſt hath loved, and doth love all, that in the Heavenly call are brought in to believe on him, and love him; and that with ſuch an apearing, and manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted love, that they may know hee loves them, whence the affirmation is heere about the kind, and manner of his love, and not ſimply of his love, as knowing they did not que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion that; For that is ſoe abundantly teſtified, that unleſſe they cloſe their eyes, and harden their harts, they cannot but know, and believe that he loves them, and that he loves them much.</p>
            <p n="1">I. In that he tooke our very nature upon him, and was made fleſh yea for our ſakes tooke ſuch fleſh, and bloud, as wee have, ſubject to weakneſſe, paines, and death, and ſo not only being God, became man, but being in the forme of God, equall with his father in glory, and majeſtie, hee our caſe requiring it, became not only man, but in faſhion as a man, in forme of a ſervant in the likeneſſe of ſinful fleſh, as a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, and no man, a reproach of men and deſpiſed of the people for our ſakes, and was not this great love, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Phill.</hi> 2.7.8.9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.6.</p>
            <p n="2">II. In that hee alſo in this meane ſhape in our nature, and ſtead, became under the law for us, and ſo in the ſame bond with us, and took upon him our dept, and had all our ſins imputed to him, and was made ſin for us, and ſo though he was innocent, yet he bare the imputation, and the ſhame, and ignominy of all our ſins, and who can deny but this great love, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Gall.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.6.12. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19.21. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.11. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2.</p>
            <pb n="32" facs="tcp:60076:17"/>
            <p n="3">III. In that he alſo bare the ſtrokes, ſuffered the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and curſe and died the death that was due to us, and ſo roſe againe acquit of all our ſins, and a victorer over curſe, and death, and preſented himſelf to his father, as the ranſome, and propitiation for our ſins, and heerin appeares great, and true love endeed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.4.5.7.8. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. and 3.18. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Gall.</hi> 1.20.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. In that he hath left his Goſpell, and received ſpirit to ſend forth to make knowne this grace, that men might come in, and receive it and procure mercy, and patience, waighting, and leading to repentance that wee might repent, and believe, and ſo partake of this grace, and this is love en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.18. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4.</p>
            <p n="5">V. In that he hath done all this for us freely, while wee not only did not deſerve it, but were even ſinners, ungodly, and his enimies, yet ſo great his love, that far leſſe then this is hardly to be found among friends, and no greater can be required in us to a friend, then he ſhewed to us, when wee were enimies to him, Oh love without compariſon, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.2.3.4. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.13. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.6.7.8.10. <hi>Coll.</hi> 1.20.21.</p>
            <p>In all which the believer may ſee love abundantly mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted to him, and this knowne, and believed there needed no ſuch particular affirmation that he loved them, for they ſee, and believed it in his becoming the propitiation for their ſins, ſo as there is no cauſe to doubt of his love, 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.16. and 4.10.16. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> Ieſus Chriſt hath ſo loved all men, as to take their nature, beare their ſins, and die their death, and give himſelf a ranſome for them and become the propitiation for their ſins, and procureth patience and mercie, with ſome, light, at ſome time, to lead them to repentance, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5.6. 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.9. Therefore all men may know themſelves ſo loved of Chriſt as well as believers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> The propoſition is True, but the inference falſe, for though it be True that he hath ſo loved all men, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.16.17. And hath beene witneſſing this his love to them in ſome meaſure, <hi>Act.</hi> 14.17. More clearly where the ſound of the Goſpell comes. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.13.14. Yet all men have not faith, 2. <hi>Theſs.</hi> 3.2. The men of the world, harkening to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments, and deluſiones of Satan, believe not the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God, no not where the Goſpell comes, and ſo have wrong thoughts of God, and either regard him not at all,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60076:17"/>but go one in ſerving their luſts, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14.1.2. and 50.21. and 10. Or elſe if they thinke of his wrath, they ſuppoſe to apaſe him by ſome other ſatisfaction, and righteouſneſſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.30.31. and 10.1.2.3. And ſo they lie in wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe, 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.19. And ſo though love of compaſſion be towards them (as it is to all not given over to Satan) yet they not believing, it is not manifeſt to them, and ſo they lying in unbeliefe they are under wrath, and condemnation becauſe of their unbeliefe, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.18.36. And therefore cannot in their unbeliefe know themſelves ſo beloved of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But ſuch as through grace believe they have ſeene, and knowne, and believed this love of Chriſt in all the before-ſaid five reſpects, whence its rightly ſaid to be manifeſted to them and through this knowledge, and faith, they come to receive, and have a taſt of his firſt loving them, 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.10.16.19. and 5.20. And are therthrough brought to depend on him, and love him, and deſue to be conformed to him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5.11. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.4.7. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.3.9. And thus, though ſuch love hath ſhewed it ſelf in Chriſt for all men, yet it is not ſo manifeſted to, nor knowne, and believed of ſuch, as lie in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believe, and ſo they have it not, but the believers know this great love in believing, and ſo have it, and yet this is not all, but it is farther evidenced to them.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. In that when God by his Spirit did through the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell evidence Chriſt, and this his love, and the fulneſſe of grace, and truth in him to them, and ſo made him to appeare ſo glorious to them, that it made all other excellencies as droſſe to them, and drew their deſires after him, and ſo cauſed them to come in, and ſubmit to him, and deſire to be found in him, and enjoye him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.5. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.14.17. and 6.44.45. <hi>Phill.</hi> 3.7.8.9. Though then they were found in their owne bloud and filth, ſo as they could not endure the ſtinch of their owne filth, nor the ſight of their owne black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and bloudineſſe, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.1.9. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.6. Yet then did not he caſt them away, but waſhed them with his bloud, ſpake peace to their hart, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.37.45. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.24. And though they wore found ſome thing ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne, untoward, and gainſaying, yet did not he faint, nor give over, but overcame their evill with goodneſſe, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed on his entertaiment, and wooing of them, till he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted them with his fathers words, and love, and united
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60076:18"/>them to himſelf in faith, and love, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.2.8. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.6.7.8. And though happily ſome even brethren, might through their weakneſſe murmur at the receite of ſuch prodigals and black-mores, to advance them to ſuch nighneſſe with himſelf, as the elder brother, at the youngers entertainment with his father, &amp; Aaron, &amp; Eminam, at Moſes marrying an Ethiopian and the believing jewes, at ſuch familiarity with believing Gentiles, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.28. <hi>Numb.</hi> 12.1.2. <hi>Act.</hi> 11.2.3. Yet he diſdained them not, nor was aſhamed of them, but as one that ſaw, and would not ſee their deformity, heredily, and kindly entertained them, and ſet his love upon them, and ſpake comfortably to their harts; <hi>Oh love endeed never to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, Iſa.</hi> 42.19.20.21. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 113.6.7.8.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. In that he hath accepted their faith, and love, and prayers, and returned them ſome diſcernable experiments of his goodneſſe, in ſuports, in troubles, ſome deliverances out of temptationes, graunts of many requeſts, ſome acceſſe, and approach to himſelf, ſome roome in his houſe, and in the harts of his; with many refreſhings in his courts, and ſome hope of future happineſſe; <hi>All fruites of love, Rom.</hi> 3.26. and 5.2.5. and 7.24.25. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.2. and 92.12. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56.5.7.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. In that they have his word for it, even written alſo for their conſolation, that they may know that he loves, and is not aſhamed to be knowne to love them, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.17. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.21.23.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. Yea they have had ſome hints, and evidences of the Holy Spirit given into their hart, of his love to them, and the Spirit is truth, and the comforter, 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.24. and 4.19. and 5.5.6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15.16.</p>
            <p>X. By all the former they come to ſee him to be their great high prieſt interceading in heaven for them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. and 9.</p>

            <p n="2">II. This manifeſted love of Chriſt, doth <hi>Admoniſh</hi> thoſe that believe in Chriſt, and love him.</p>
            <p n="1">I. In all conditiones, and how-ever things apeare to ſence; yet to acknowledge him to have loved us, and to be loving, and gracious to us, to be good, and to doe good, and praiſe him for his kindneſſe, and wonderfull works, waiting on him for his goodneſſe to be ſhewne us in due time, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.1. and 145. to the end. <hi>Phill.</hi> 4.4.7. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107. to the end. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.18. <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.26, 31. Let hoe affliction cauſe us to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur againſt him, or be jealous of his love, for that is great; wee have cauſe to be jealous of our own love, and he might ſay to us, wherein have you loved mee, and wee might be ſilent; but yet he accepts and remembers, the ſmall fruites of his Spirit in us, and forgets not the love of our eſpouſealls; though it were but the fruites of his own firſt diſcovered love. <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.10. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.19; And ſhall wee for a little hideing, and ſilence of his, or a few afflictions from him call in queſtion al his love, and in beholding the fulneſſe of others ſay to him, wherein haſt thou loved us: far bee it from us; hee can not but behold it as an evill in us, that he hath ſo loved us, as to take our nature, beare out ſins, ſuffer our curſe, and give himſelfe a ranſome for us, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the propitiation for our ſins, and al this for us, while we were his enemies, and yet we to ſay wherein haſt thou loved us. If thou ſay, hee hath ſo loved al men; yet I pray the conſider: he hath not ſo made it known to al men, and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the knowledge thereof to their harts, as he hath done to thee, they are thy Brethren, created by the ſame God, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60076:20"/>by the ſame Lord, and of as good nature, parts, and other naturall qualificationes, and performances, as thou, and no worſe, then thou wert, yet he ſuffers them to lye in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and to reſt upon ſuch mountaines of worldly, riches, friends, fleſhly wiſedome, or ſelf wrought righteouſneſſe, as he hath blaſted, and will bring downe, and as will fayle them; But he hath diſcovered to the, the mountain of Iſrael, and brought thee out of darkneſſe into light, and gained thee to himſelfe, with the knowledge of his love ſoe manifeſted, that himſelfe might be thy mountaine, thy peace, thy righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, thy life, and hath often made thee taſt his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; and is now but confirming thee to him, in his croſſe, and death, that thou mayeſt partake of his reſurrection, and life, and wilt thou ſo forget all his goodneſſe as to ſay where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in haſt thou loved mee.

            <p n="2">II. To learne of Chriſt to love others, as wee have been, and are loved of Chriſt Jeſus, to love ſuch as are yet enimies to us, and know not Chriſt with the love of compaſſiones, as Chriſt did us when we were enimies to him, &amp; without parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of their ſins, or delightfull fellowſhip with them in their wayes, to uſe meekeneſſe patience, and long-ſuffering to them, and pray for them, and ſeeke to overcome their evill with goodneſſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.44, 45. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.17, 21. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.2.3, 4. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.22, 23, 24. To love believers, with love of delight exerciſing bowels of mercies to them, bearing their infirmities, and burthens, having fellowſhip with them, continuing in Brotherly love. <hi>Coll.</hi> 3.12, 16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14 and 15. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.10, 11. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. and 13, 1. But this with other uſes do more fully flow from the next obſervation joyned to this.</p>
            <p n="3">III. This love of Jeſus Chriſt ſo manifeſted may bee a ground of exortation to us, to mind, and heed wel this his love, that we may be more abundantly firmed in the beliefe heeroff, it beeing the ground of our believing, and that which believed doth facillitate our beliefe of that more abundant love, that followeth to be ſpoken of. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1, 5, 10, 11. and 8.31, 36. <hi>Gall.</hi> 2.20. And while there remayneth doubtfulneſſe in this, there can be no ſtabillity in the beliefe of that which followeth now to be ſpoken of in the next ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.12. and 6.61, 62, 63.</p>
            <pb n="39" facs="tcp:60076:20"/>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>II. Obſe.</hi> That Ieſus Chriſt loveth thoſe that believe in him, and love him, even as the Father hath loved him; In which obſervation, there is ſomething cloſely intimated, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely: That the love of Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in, and through him, to ſuch as believe in Jeſus Chriſt, and love him, is a ſpeciall, and peculiar love; above all that love in which he loveth any other of the ſous of men, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.6.7. Truth it is, he loveth all the ſons of men (till they become of the ſeed of the Serpent) with the love of compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and willingneſſe to have them come in to him. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.8, 9. <hi>Pro.</hi> 8.4, 5, 31. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16, 17. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15.

But ſuch cleare and powerfull diſcovery of his love, and goodneſſe, as doth cauſe the hart, ſo to know, believe, and acknowledge the ſame, that one is overcome thereby to believe on him, and love him, is a ſpeciall, and peculiar in his love, not only love, and grace with generall effects, but a ſpecial favour, and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall gift of grace. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.16.17.18. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.16, 19. and 5.20 <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11, 12. and 3.3, 4, 5. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2, 8.

            <p>And ſomething in this obſervation is fully, and plainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, namely ſuch a peculiar love, as is not peculiar only in reſpect of the manifeſtation, and diſcovery thereof as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mencioned, but it is peculiar alſo in it ſelfe, ſuch as never was, is, or ſhall be to any but them, and ſuch as they are. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 132.13.14.15. and 148.14. and 149.4. <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.26.29.

And this is a peculiar love, above all the love he beareth to any other of the ſons of men in which alſo he makes them a peculiar people to himſelf, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2, 9. And of this love is the obſervation now in hand, which cannot be better expreſſed then in the words of our ſaviour himſelf, which alſo is the proof thereof.</p>
            <q>As the Father hach loved mee, ſo have I loved you.</q>
            <p>In which for our better underſtanding, and uſefulneſſe, there are three things contained to be viewed, and heeded of us.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. The firſt intimated, as denied by none, viz. <hi>the Father hath loved Ieſus Chriſt his ſon.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>II. The ſecond to be inquired into in other his ſayings, which giveth light to that affirmed, viz. <hi>how the Father hath loved Ieſus Chriſt his ſon.</hi>

               <item>III. The third expreſſe, viz. the affirmation it ſelf, <hi>as the Father hath loved mee, ſo have I loved you.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">I. For the firſt that the Father hath loved Ieſus Chriſt his ſon, and ſo loveth him, is expreſly affirmed, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5, 20. The Father loveth the Son, but an explication is to many more needfull in this, then a proofe, leaſt the conceptiones of ſome bee too ſcant in this matter, in which wee are not to conſider Ieſus Chriſt only as the ſecond perſon of the three, and ſo the ſon in reſpect of the devine nature, without conſideration of the fleſh, that once was to be, and now is taken, and ſo of the love only in which the three perſons in one God, delight in each other, and ſo God hath all fulneſſe of delight in himſelf, but wee are to conſider the ſecond perſon, the ſon of God (as once he was to take, and now hath taken fleſh, and ſo) as he was found in our nature and ſtood as the publick perſon in the roome of all, and became the propitiation for the ſins of the whole world, and the Advocate for believers, the king, prieſt, and prophet, and the head, and Husband of the church, as he was vile, and diſpiſed in the account of men, and yet a lover of men, and ſo approved of the father, and ſo hath the father loved him, as hee is ſuch a one, <hi>Pro.</hi> 8.22, 23, 30. <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.18. <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.17, and 17, 5. Yea he loved him in his laying downe his life; and making the propitiation, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10, 17. <hi>Phill.</hi> 2, 7, 11. As alſo in his miniſtration, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17, 5. And in receit, and approbation of thoſe given him in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly call, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.1, 2, 8. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16, 27. And Ieſus Chriſt thus conſidered as he tooke our nature, and wrought for us,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:60076:21"/>the father hath loved him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53, 1, 2, 6, 11.12.</p>
            <p n="2">II. For the ſecond thing how the father hath loved Ieſus Chriſt his ſon, and our ſaviour, it is beyond conception, and expreſſion of mortals though ſome what thereof may be conceived, and expreſſed, as the ſcripture declares, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.18.19. And ſo according to the meaſure of light given wee may conſider it two wayes.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>Negatively;</hi> Not with a worldly, and humane love, ſuch as is in the men of the world, and as the men of the world teſtify their love, who deſire for, and wiſh unto, and to their abillity confer upon thoſe whom they moſt love, moſt of the honours, riches, authority, powre, liberty pleaſures, and good report among men, that is in this world and the things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <hi>Heſt.</hi> 6.6, 9. <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.1, 2, 3. <hi>Gen.</hi> 41.39.44.

For in theſe things the father did not ſet forth his love to leſus Chriſt his ſon, and our ſaviour, but abaſed him in all ſuch things, for worldly honours he was not ſild with, but abuſed in the meaneneſſe, and contemptibleneſſe of his birth in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of parentage, and place, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.4, 7.

As for worldly rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, hee was not furniſhed, but in that reſpect very pore, <hi>Mat:</hi> 8.20, and 17, 27.

As for hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane repute, and good report among men of moſt credit, and eſteeme in the world and their followers; he was by them
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:60076:22"/>defamed, reproached, and ſlandered, and that many wayes, they defamed him by his parentage, and kinred, this the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters ſon, &amp;c. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13, 55, 56, 57. And by his trade he had uſed before his miniſtration, <hi>Mar.</hi> 6.3.

And not only defamed, but alſo ſlandered him for his converſation with men, to be a gluttonous perſon, and a wine bibber, and a friend of Publicanes, and ſinners, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.19. For his readineſſe to do good, and to ſhew mercy at all ſeaſones, a breaker of the Sabbaths, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5, 16, and 9, 16. For his zeale, to have a devil, and his miracles to be done by the devill, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7, 20, and 8, 48. <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.34, and 12, 24. For his doctrine to be a deceiver, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.63. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7.12. And for his holy and plaine confeſſion of the truth, to be a blaſphemer of God <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.36. <hi>Mat.</hi> 26, 65.

And as for liberty and pleaſures among men, he was often conſpired againſt, continually perſecuted, and at laſt buffetted, nailed on the croſſe between two theeves, and there derided and ſcoffed at, and ſo died, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12, 14, and 26, and 27. In a word, he was ſo far from being glorious, or great in the world, that in ſuch reſpects, he was as a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, and no man, a reproach of men, and deſpiſed of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, without forme or bewtie, rejected of men; &amp;c. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.6.7. So that the love wherewith the Father loved Ieſus Chriſt was not a worldly love, nor teſtified by filling him with worldly things, the abundance whereof, he very often giveth to his enimies, ſometimes, as rewards for ſome ſervices he hath done by them though they knew him not, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 29.18.19. Sometimes, in judgement to their farther ſnaring, and hardening, and overthrow, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.18, and 92, 6, 7. So as this love is not worldly, but heavenly, and though hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly yet.</p>
            <p>Not only a love of compaſſion, which may be towards ſuch as one is angry with, and counts ſinners for their evils, and is conſtrained to afflict them, though with bowels of compaſſion yearning over them, ſo as in returning, they may be ſaved, and in rebelling given up, <hi>Hoſe.</hi> 11.4.9. <hi>Luk.</hi> 19, 41, 42. For ſo God loved the world, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.16, 17, 18, 19. But his love to his ſon was a greater love then this,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:60076:22"/>
               <hi>Coll.</hi> 1.18, 19, and <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. to the end. Yet though it were a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and more peculiar love.</p>
            <p>It was not from the firſt appearance, to the accompliſhment of full perfection in the glorious harveſt a conſtant appearing, and brightly ſhining love, admitting no clouds, darkneſſes, nor eclipſes; but ſuch love it was, as had its degrees of appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and ſome intermixtures of clouds, and darkneſſe, in reſpect of the viſible appearance, and a great eclipſe on the croſſe, before all clouds were paſſed, and the fulneſſe of the glorious appearance, and enjoyment came into its perfection. <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. to the end. <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.17, and 4, to the end. and 17, 5, and 26, 8, 42, and 27, 46.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Affirmatively, the Father hath loved his ſon, our ſavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Ieſus Chriſt with a devine, heavenly, pure, Fatherly; and Spirituall love beyond all our conceptiones, only wee may veiw it in the properties of it.</p>
            <p n="1">I. It is a moſt free, and righteous love, it is a free love, which with out any fore-deſert did faſten upon the man Chriſt Ieſus, and choſe him into union of perſon with the ſon of God, and ſo to be one, and his only ſon, and alſo to be the ſaviour of the world, and alſo to be the mediator, and the high prieſt prophet, and King, and head, and husband of the church, and that all fulneſſe ſhould dwell in him, and that in all things he might have the preheminence, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.19.20.27, 28. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42, 1, and 49, 6, 7, 8. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1, 2, 8, and 7. <hi>Coll.</hi> 1.19. And all this freely, becauſe it ſo pleaſed him, and ſuch his love, yet it is alſo a righteouſly love, ſlowing upon him accepting, and preferring him, in, and for, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to all that he hath done in the work of redemption for men, and that he doth in ſpiritual application to, and in, and advocation for, and government of his called, and choſen ones, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14, 9, 12. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.17. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2, 9. <hi>Phill.</hi> 2.8, 9, 10. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 20, 3, 4, 5, and 45, 6, 7, 8.</p>
            <p n="2">II. It is a moſt well-pleaſed, delightfull, and ſatisfying love, taking up all well-pleaſed in the beloved, and affording all well-pleaſedneſſe, to the beloved, the Father having ſo ſet all his delight in his ſon that he delighteth in him, and in all that is in his ſon, and in nothing out of his ſon, that he taketh all fulneſſe of content, and well-pleaſedneſſe in his ſon, and in that which his ſon hath done, in his miniſtration, ſufferings, ſacrifice, and victorie, and in that which his ſon doth, by his ſpirituall opperationes, and communicationes of privilledges,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:60076:23"/>and in all that are in his ſon, and preſented by him, ſo as in that his well-pleaſedneſſe he affords well-pleaſedneſſe to his ſon, and to all that are in, and one with his ſon, <hi>Pro.</hi> 8, 22, 23, 30. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.1. <hi>Mat.</hi> 12, 18, and 3, 17, and 17, 5. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10, 7, 12, 13, 14. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 20, 3, 6. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16, 27. <hi>Gall.</hi> 3.16, 29, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1, 30.</p>
            <p n="3">III. It is a moſt abundant, and flowing love, reſting not till the beloved be partaker of, and ſilled with all his owne things, and with union, and fellowſhip with himſelf, ſo hath the Father loved Ieſus Chriſt as he hath him ever with him, an I before him, as the ſeale on his hart, and the ſeale upon his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

Yea ſo as hee is one in, and with the Son, and the Son one in, and with him. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.30. and 14.10, 11. and 17, 21. Yea ſo as hee conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth on his Son, and maketh him partaker, and owner of al his own things; his devine nature, his Holy Spirit, his attributes of wiſedome, power, goodneſſe, &amp;c. His ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall people, and all the works of his hands, ſo as: all that is the Fathers is the Sons, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16.15. and 17, 6.10. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.2.3.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. It is a moſt glorious, honourable, and honouring love; the Father hath ſo loved his Son Jeſus Chriſt our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour that he hath honoured, or glorified him with his own ſelfe, with infinit glory, yea, and with ſuch apearing honour alſo, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.1.5. That he wil not be known, or acknowledged, loved or honoured in any thing by any man, by any way, or meanes, but in, and by his ſon, and as the man knoweth acknowledgeth, loveth, and honoureth his Son Chriſt, <hi>Ioh</hi> 5.23. and 14.6, 7. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.23. Whom he will have honoured as himſelf, yea he hath honoured his Son, by giving an honourable teſtimony of him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.20.21.28. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.33. <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.17. and 17.5. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. to the end.

Yea he hath gloriſied, and honoured him, by exalting him at his right hand; Giving all authority unto him, and making him the Lord, and judge of all. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9. and 8.1. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.18. <hi>Jeh.</hi> 5.27. Yea he hath giver him the Kingdome, and the enheritance, and made him the King, and he ſhall rayn for
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:60076:23"/>evermore, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. to the end. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. to the end. Yea he ſo preferreth his ſon in honour, that he honoureth all thoſe that in the day of grace do honour him, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14, 21, 23, and 16, 27. And will repay thoſe that perſiſt in hating him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.</p>
            <p n="5">V. It is an eternall, and everlaſting love, hee loved him from all eternity, and to eternity, hee is the prime elect, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42, 1. Hee loved him before he tooke fleſh, and when he tooke fleſh, yea alwayes while he was heere on earth, in all his temptationes, poverties, ſufferings, miniſtration death, and reſm rection, and now at his right hand, and ſo for ever, <hi>Pro.</hi> 8, 22, 30. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.30, 32. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5, 20, 27. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.6, and 16, 6, 7, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And with ſuch devine, Fatherly love, ſo free, righteous, delightfull ſatisfying, abundant flowing, hononrable, and honouring, and everlaſting love, hath the Father ever loved the ſon (though it was not in all times ſo viſible) when he was heere on earth) and ever doth, and will thus love him, and thus wee have ſome ſmall diſcovery of that which in the excellency, and perfection thereof, is beyond all our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, much more beyond our expreſſion, his love being infeint, and in comprehenſible, paſſing knowledge.</p>
            <p n="3">III. For the third thing, viz. the affirmation it ſelf, <hi>as the Father hath loved mee, ſo have I loved you,</hi> this is the profeſſion, and explanation of his great love with the peculiar manner of his loving, <hi>as the Father hath loved him,</hi> viz.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Not with a humane, and worldly love, to be teſtified after the manner of the world, in advancing them, and freeing them from ſufferings, in ſuch glory, fame, good report, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, riches, authority friend-ſhip, liberty among men, as is in, and of this world, wherein they ſhall be falſely accuſed, hated, perſecuted, and have many tribulationes, as hee had, but in him they ſhall have peace, and comfort, as he had in his Father, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10, 17, 25. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14, 27, and 15, 18, 21, and 16, 32, 33.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Nor only with a love of compaſſion, and extention of ſome fruites thereof, for ſo he hath loved all men, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 136, 26, and 145, 8, 9. And ſo he loved them, when they were his enemies, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5, 7, 10. Nor yet only with ſuch a peculiarity in this loving, as to make them to know, and enjoy the comfort of this his compaſſionate love, in the giving himſelf, a ranſome for them, and the peace, the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60076:24"/>the bownty, the ſupports, and ſupplies there through vouchſafed them in all their needs, and trials ſo as they may experiment his love, and tender mercy in the ſame, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116, 1.2.8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5, 2, 4, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3, 10, Wherein he tenders them in ſome ſort becauſe of their weakneſſe, more then himſelf on earth was, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22, 6, 7. And though this love of compaſſion made knowne and enjoyed be ſweete, graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and opperative love, yet this love is higher and more peculiar, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Yet</p>
            <p n="3">III. Not ſuch a love, or ſo loving as admits no cloud, darkenings, or eclipſes from the knowledge, or percepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the beloved, after the firſt appearance, till the harveſt, or fulneſſe of enjoyment, but ſuch as betweene the firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, and the full comming in of the harveſt may admit ſome clouds, hidings, and eclipſes for a ſeaſon, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.6, 7. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12, 6, 7. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.17, 18. <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.1, 4, and 5, 8, 21.</p>
            <p>But with ſuch a devine, ſpirituall, and peculiar love, as in which his Father loveth him, his ſon, he loveth thoſe that believe on him, and love him.</p>
            <p n="1">I. With a moſt free, and righteous love, hee hath loved, and doth love them moſt freely, not for any worth, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, or any excellency found in them, or thoſe from whom they received their firſt birth, for they were ſo far from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any thing deſerving love, that they were full of ſuch filth, as deſerved hatred, yea ſuch as could not bee taken of without his dieing for them, which he did even while they were his enemies, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16, 1, 9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5, 8, 10. And notwithſtanding, he ſtill found them ſinfull, and rebellious to the day of his call, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1, 12, 13, 14, 15. <hi>Coll.</hi> 1.13, 21, 22. Yea even when he ſet his eye on them to take them to himſelf, and for his owne, he found them in their filth, and bloud, and in oneneſſe, and fellowſhip with the world, and yet did hee freely ſet his love on them and by his Spirit waſhed them from their ſins in his owne bloud, and graciouſly choſe them out of the world, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16, 6. <hi>Rec.</hi> 1, 5. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15, 16, 19. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.3, 4, 5, 6.</p>
            <p>So that his love is altogether free; and as it is free, ſo it is righteous hee having offered the ſacrifice, and preſented his bloud to his Father, ſo as mercy and truth are met and by vew of his bloud purged their conſciences, and preſenting them in himſelf to the Father, who counts them righteous it
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:60076:24"/>him, hee loving them with a righteous love, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85.10.11, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.12, 14. And alſo:</p>
            <p>Hee in this freeneſſe of his love having given his promiſe; hee is righteous to perform, hee is alſo ſo righteous in love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that he will treaſure up, and not forget, but both make proſperous, and alſo recompenſe every fruite, and worke of his own Spirit in them, and that according as his grace, prevailes in them, and leads them, to yeild up themſelves, and their members therein, and thereto, in the ſervices, and ſufferings of love for him, and their brethren, and this alſo hee doth freely, and for his own ſake. <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.10. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.6. <hi>Gall.</hi> 6.8. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10, 41, 42. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.11. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9.</p>
            <p n="2">II. With a moſt delightfull, and well-pleaſed love, he hath ſet his delight and taketh pleaſure in them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.3. &amp; 33, 18. and 149.4. And is well-pleaſed with them, as they are in him, and have him living in them, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.1.9. <hi>Gall.</hi> 2, 20. And ſoe with all that which by his Spirit hee worketh in them, and which through that Spirit, hee cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth them to doe, in prayers, prayſes, and ſervices of love. <hi>Jer.</hi> 9, 24. <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.8. Yea ſo delightful is he in this his love, and ſo well-pleaſed, that he hath ſet his deſire, and placed his reſt for an habitation in, and with them, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.9, 10. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 132, 13, 14. Yea ſo as hee affords them ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, and well-pleaſedneſſe in this his well-pleaſedneſſe with them. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23. and 30, 3, 4, 5. and 116.1.2, 10.</p>
            <p n="3">III. With a moſt abundant, and flowing love, his love ſo flowing on them, that he hath them ever before him, and his gracious eye upon them, <hi>Pſal,</hi> 34, 15. So that hee ſets them as the ſeale upon his hart, and as the ſeale on his arm. <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.6. And hath graven them upon the palmes of his hands, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49, 16; So that hee worketh al their works in them, and doth all his works for them, and cauſeth all to work together for good to them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26, 12. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 138, 8, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8, 28, Yea ſo as in due ſeaſon, he imparteth all his counſells, and maketh them to know his mind, and all his works, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15, 15, 16. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.20, 27. Yea even ſo that all his ſufferings, death, reſurrection, aſcenſion, his victory, wiſedome, righteouſneſſe, ſanctification, and redemption is become theires, as if they had done all. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.12. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5, 14. Yea hee conferreth on
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:60076:25"/>them, and maketh them owners, and partakers of all that is his; even of his devine nature, in union, intereſt, uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and comformity; and ſoe of all things pertayning to life, and godlineſſe, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1, 2, 3, 4. Yea ſoe that his Father, himſelf, his Spirit, his covenant, his privilidges, his inheritance, his people are all theirs; And this ſo ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, that they and all that is theirs, is gained to bee, and made his, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.22.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. With a moſt honourable, and honouring love, the Lord Jeſus ſo loving thoſe that believe on him, and love him, that, hee will not accept to be loved, received, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged of any, that doe not in, with, and for him in a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, love receive, and acknowledge them; but counts all that is done to them, as done to himſelf, whether in love, or hatred, and will not otherwiſe reckon of it, but in ſome meaſure will have them in, and for him loved as himſelfe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18, 5, 6. and 45, 40, 44. <hi>Luk</hi> 10.16, <hi>Act.</hi> 9.4, 5. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4, 17, 21. He putteth his name upon them, and his Spirit in them, and ſo beareth teſtimony, in, to, and through them, 2 <hi>Cron.</hi> 7, 14, 16. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.21. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11, 3. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2, 17. Hee giveth to them the Kingdome, and enheritance, the Father hath given him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22, 29. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12, 28; and hee will have them to raine with himſelfe, and make them rule over the nations, and judge the world, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.26, 27. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.2. Yea hee bleſſeth, and honoureth with bleſſings, ſuch as bleſſe, love, eſteem them. <hi>Gen.</hi> 12, 3. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15.1.4. And this ſo ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, that they ſo honour him.</p>
            <p n="5">V. With an everlaſting love, hee hath loved them from eternity, in the roote and nature, <hi>Pro.</hi> 8.30, 31. And doth ſoe love them to eternity in roote and branches, as they can never drop out of this love of his, <hi>Ier.</hi> 31, 3. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13, 1. He loved them before they were, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. And when they were his enemies, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5, 6.10. And when he called them, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3, 4.7. And hee loves them, even when he ſpeakes hardly to them, and chaſtiſeth them, <hi>Ier.</hi> 31.20. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.6. And when they are in tribulationes, and ſufferings for his ſake, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.15. And when they bring forth the fruites of his Spirit, and approach to him, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.9, 15. Yea he will love them for ever, and it ſhall ſhine forth upon them, without any darkneſſe, or interup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when they ſhal be with him, and ſee his glory ſeeing as

And this ſo opperative, as it unites them in love to him for ever, and thus as the father hath loved his ſon Ieſus Chriſt, ſo hath, and doth Ieſus Chriſt love thoſe that believe on him, and love him, only in this wee are to heed this caution, to keep us ſober in the beliefe of ſo great love, <hi>viz.</hi> That as Ieſus Chriſt made the propitiation him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for us in, and by himſelf without us, ſo hee, and hee only is the fountaine and cauſe in and through himſelf, of all this love, and fruites thereof to us ſo that in this reſpect he hath no partners, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.9. <hi>Hoſe.</hi> 14, 8. And for the communication of this his delightful love, and fruites thereof, he doth it according to his Fathers mind, who in al things will have his ſon Ieſus to have the preheminence, his portion with out bounds, or meaſure, immeaſurable, but to every one that believeth on him, a meaſure, according to the meaſure of Chriſt, <hi>Coll.</hi> 1, 19. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3, 33. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.7. And this obſerved, wee may ſafely affirme, and verily believe, that as God the Father hath loved all men with a love of compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſo hath Ieſus Chriſt ſo alſo loved them that he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven himſelf a ranſome for all men, to be teſtified in due time, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.16, 17. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4, 14. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. Even ſo as the Father hath loved, and loveth his ſon Ieſus Chriſt with a higher degree of love, and a more peculiar love, then he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the world for whoſe redemption he ſent him forth, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5, 20. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14, 9, 12. Even ſo the Lord Ieſus Chriſt hath loved, and doth love all thoſe, that by his grace and Spirit are in the heavenly call brought into believe in him, and love him, even with the ſame devine, Spirituall, free, righteous delightfull, well-pleaſed, abundant, flowing, honourable, honouring, and everlaſting love, in which the Father hath loved, and loveth him, himſelf, having aſſirmed it.</p>

               <p>If the Lord exerciſe you with wants in outward things, &amp; many tribulationes, yet be not diſcouraged, but rejoyce in the Lord that hee is your portion, and that you have in him all fullneſſe of ſpirituall bleſſings, and treaſure that cannot be waſted, and that hee hath ſet his love on you, and giveth you all things pertaining to life, and Godlineſſe, and will cauſe all things to work for the beſt to you, and after a little tryall poſſeſſe you with the crowne of life, let the beliefe heereof cauſe you to endure, as ſeeing him, who is inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and ſuffer not temporary aſſlictiones, to hinder your rejoycing in him, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.19.24, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.55, 57. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.3. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3, 4. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.26.27. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.6. <hi>Who will in due ſeaſon fill you with joy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the Lord try you with ſome darkneſſe, hidings of his face though that bee the foreſt of all tryals; yet let not your hart ſinck into diſcouragement, nor count it a ſtrange thing, as if it could not ſtand with peculiar love, or might not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall beloved ſons, but in the depth of humilliation, and aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of your ſelves; yet rejoyce in the Lord that is yours, and hath appeared to you, and becauſe he loved you with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting love, hath drawne you with loving kindneſſe, and though he hide his face from you both ſtill, even now love you, and is your light and protexion, in him is noe change; and in due ſeaſon, he will return againe to you, and bring you forth to the light, and you ſhall ſee his righteouſneſſe, <hi>Ier.</hi> 31.3.20. <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.31. <hi>Mich.</hi> 7.7, 8, 9, 10. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore rejoyce in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If divers temptationes aſſaults you, rejoyce not in ſight of many outward, and ſencible helps, and props, but rejoyce in the Lord, and in the powre of his might, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.10. &amp;c. In a word: when you a proach his courts, and uſe his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances; yea, and at all times rejoyce in the Lord, becauſe of this his great, and peculiar love, and lovenineſſe. <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.4.</p>
               <p n="2">II. To be meeke, and patient in all the tryals, we meete withall for the profeſſion of the Goſpell, and for walking in

And that alſo ſeeing. It is agreable to the having of his choyſe love to goe through many ſufferings in the ſervices of love, <hi>Act.</hi> 9.15, 16. It is from the hand of our well-beloved, that loves us ſo dearly, who is the Lord of all, and all are his ſervants. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 3.14. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.89, 90, 92. It is the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed way to paſſe through, before we can come to enjoy the harveſt, and fulneſſe of his peculiar love, and choiſe fruites thereof, <hi>Act.</hi> 14.22; And that in due ſeaſon as wee ſuffer with him, wee ſhall raine with him, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.12.</p>
               <p n="3">III. To love one another as Jeſus Chriſt hath loved us, even ſo freely, delightfully, flowingly, &amp;c. And to walk in ſuch love, and fellowſhip together, &amp;c. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.1.2. To all which by this love of Chriſt we may be exorted, but the ſpeciall uſe, in which wee may come to ſee, and ataine to all ſet forth, in theſe uſes is that which followes in the next point.</p>
               <p>The Second thing to bee veiwed is, Our Saviours gracious invitation, or charge. Viz. <hi>Continue yea in my love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This ſentence by the whole drift, &amp; ſcope of our Saviours inſtruction in the ſimily from <hi>Verſ.</hi> 1. to this 9 <hi>Verſ.</hi> apea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res to be ment in as large a ſence as <hi>Verſ.</hi> 4. <hi>Abide in me, and I in you,</hi> and as <hi>Verſ.</hi> 7. <hi>If yee abide in mee, and my words in you: Soc as the ſence appeares to bee twofold.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Continue yea in my love,</hi> That is, Depend and reſt upon it, and reſt your ſelves ſatisfied with it, and turne not aſide from this my love, to ſeeke, or deſire any other loves beſide mine, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.7, 8. and 73.23, 26. and 23. and 27. 1. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.12, 16. and 30.15.16.</p>
               <p>Secondly: <hi>Continue yea in my love,</hi> That is, let it bee ever with you, in you, and before you, and have its perfect working in you in all its operationes, and doe not ſmoother it, or ſhrinck from it in any of its workings, and motiones, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.3. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>So that the meaning of the words apeare to bee as much, as if our Saviour had ſaid in more words to his diſciples, and to us in them.</p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>Continue yea in my love,</hi> take up all your ſatisfying, and well-pleaſedneſſe therein, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.5, 6, 7, and 18, 1, 2, 3.

               <p n="2">II. <hi>Continue ye in my love,</hi> walk in it, and yeild up your ſelves to go forth in all the opperationes of it, doing all you do in the remembrance, beliefe, of, and confidence in this my love, and in ſubmiſſion too and walking in the ſame, <hi>Coll.</hi> 3.16, 17, and 2, 6. <hi>Gall.</hi> 2.20. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.17, and 12, 1.2. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.2.6. So that to take the ſence, both in a briefe ſumme, and in an amplified explication it comes both into the ſame ſence, As.</p>
               <p n="1">I. To take it in a briefe ſumme, it appeares to have this ſence, <hi>continue yea in my love,</hi> (that is as much as to ſay) ſo cleave to me, and demane your ſelves to mee-ward, in accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of, and yeelding to my love, in taking all your ſatisfying in it, and yeelding all your ſervice to it, that you neither turne aſide, and wind out your ſelves from it nor cauſe mee to hide, or withdraw it from you, ſuitable to this are ſuch pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and exhortations, as. <hi>Coll.</hi> 1.9, 10, 11, and 3, 9, 10, 16 <hi>Eph.</hi> 3, 16, 19, and 4, 1, 7, 22, 24. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.2.</p>
               <p>For ſuch as ſo continue in his love, that by his love, they be enflamed with, and led out in the love of him, ſhall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of more abundant teſtimonies of love from him, <hi>Pro.</hi> 8.27. <hi>Jeh.</hi> 14.21, 23.

Therefore for our profit he ſaid, <hi>continue yea in my love,</hi> viz. in reſting in, and yeelding to my love.</p>
               <p n="2">II. To take the ſence in an amplified explication in ſome particular branches, to continue in this love of Chriſt contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in it theſe particulars.</p>

               <p>Firſt: For the things to be enquired into that wee may know them, the firſt is what were the Fathers command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments concerning Jeſus Chriſt, and in the ſcripture they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to bee, theſe two commandments.</p>
               <p n="1">I. That he ſhould ſave all men, by giving himſelf a ranſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, and offering up himſelf a ſacrifice for them, to make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation for their ſins, ſo as to make them ſaveable, and to open the door for a ſpeciall and eternal ſaluation, for al thoſe that ſubmit to him, and believe on him, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4, 5, 6.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:60076:34"/>
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.7. And this command encludes in it his taking the nature of mankind, ſubject to humane infirmities, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3. His being made under the law for them that were under the law, <hi>Gall.</hi> 4.4.5. His bearing the ſins of the world, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.29. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. His dying the death for every man, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9 His riſing againe acquit of all the ſins imputed to him, and a victorer over all the curſe, and death impoſed on him, and over all the enemies he conflicted with, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.4. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.22. And ſo by the eternall Spirit offering himſelf with out ſpot to God, ſealing the new Teſtament with his precious bloud, and with the vertue thereof entred the holy of holies, to make reconciliation for the ſins of the people, and appeares in heaven before God for them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.11.12.14, 15, 16, 17, 23.24. All this is in the firſt commandment.</p>
               <p n="2">II. That he ſhould bring all men to the knowledge of the truth, and ſo enlighten, and convince them, that the Lord may dwell among them, and how ever, that they may be brought to acknowledge Jeſus the Lord to the glory of God, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4.6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.9.11.12. And more eſpecially ſuch as are in the day of grace ſubmitted to the acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the truth, to guide them into all truth, and to unite, and conforme them to himſelf, making them meete for, and in due ſeaſon partakers of the inheritance with himſelf, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16.13, 14, 15. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.4, 5, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3, 18. <hi>Coll.</hi> 1.12.13. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.3.9. And this commandment containes in it, His declaration of the Goſpell, His communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Spirit, His enliving the dead, His opening the eyes of the blind, and the eares of the deaf, his bringing the priſoners out of priſon; his comforting, cloathing, and bew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying them with grace, and glory, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.1.2, 3. <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.18, 21. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.1, 8, and 49, 6, 9. And that theſe two commandments, the one to work, and accompliſh in himſelf, as the publick perſon in the roome, and place, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſalvation for mankind with God by giving himſelf a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome for them, and ſo purchaſing them into his owne diſpoſe as their Lord, and ſo making them ſaveable, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.9.10.11.12. The other to offer the knowledge, and tenders of this grace to them, that they may come to the knowledge of the truth, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.9. And that ſuch as are ſubmitted to the acknowledgment of the truth in the day of grace, and abide therein, hee to confer upon them, and work in them eternall
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:60076:34"/>ſaluation, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8.31.36. That theſe bee the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Father concerning Jeſus Chriſt our Lord is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident.</p>
               <p n="1">I. By the expreſſe, and plaine affirmation of the ſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, ſpeaking of the mind, and will of God, concerning the Man Jeſus Chriſt the mediator betweene God, and men what God willeth concerning him, that he would have done by him; It ſaith of the firſt, <hi>God will have all men to be ſaved,</hi> And of the ſecond, <hi>And come to the knowledge of the truth;</hi> And ſpeaking of the anſwerable performance by Chriſt it ſaith of the firſt, hee gave himſelf a ranſome for all, and of the ſecond, a teſtimony, or to be teſtified in due time, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4.5.6. Both which are expreſly ſaid in other places alſo, to bee his will to be done by Chriſt, and which he came and undertooke to doc, and having ſiniſhed the one part, that reſpecteth the one commandment, and beene per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming, and ſtil is performing the other part of his wil which reſpecteth the other commandment, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.7, 8, 9, 10 <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.7, 9, 10, 12, 15, 16. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.1.2.3.</p>
               <p n="2">II. By the plaine teſtimony, and confeſſion of Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, who as he was abaſed, and died for our ſins, and roſe for our juſtification, and ſo offered himſelf as the ranſome to God, and became the propitiation for the ſins of the world ſo he comprehendeth his humilation death, and reſurrection, under the firſt part of the will of his Father, and calleth it his commandment, ſaying I have powre to lay downe my life, and I have powre to take it again, this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment have I received of my Father, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.18. And of this part of Gods will its moſt probable he ſpake, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.38.39. <hi>I came down from heaven not to doe mine owne will, but the will of him that ſent mee, and this is the Fathers will, which hath ſent mee, that of all that he hath given mee I ſhould looſe none, but ſhould raiſe it up againe at the laſt day,</hi> Agreeable to that is ſaid els-where. <hi>As in Adam all die ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.22. Agreeable to that which he after ſaith, <hi>The bread which I will give, is my fleſh, which I will give for the life of the world, Ioh.</hi> 6.51. And this to be heere-ment appeares. I. In that this ſaid, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 38.39. Is made the ground of his faithfulneſſe, and powre, for that he ſaid before, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 37. and after, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 40. II. In that the phraſe is altered, Heere is ſaid, hath given (as intimating to purchaſe) but in <hi>Verſ.</hi> 37. It is ſaid, giveth (as intimating
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:60076:35"/>by the heavenly call) III. And in that the other part of his will is expreſt as diſtinct, and in other tearmes, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 40. And to manifeſt his love, and obedience to his Father in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, in laying downe his life, and offering himſelf as the ſacrifice for the ſin of the world, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.29. That the world might know it, when he was in the houſe, where thoſe that ſought to apprehend him could not have come to take him, he ſaid that the world may know, that I love the Father, and as the Father gave mee commandment, even ſo I doe, ariſe, let us go hence, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.31. And thus have wee the firſt commandment given to Chriſt, ſet forth by his owne teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
               <p>And for the other commandements; hee ſaith expreſly, <hi>This is the will of him that ſent mee, that every one that ſeeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlaſting life; and I will raiſe him up at the laſt daye, Ioh.</hi> 6.40. (intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, To glory for all ſhall riſe,) and ſpeaking of the Goſpel, and the miniſtration thereof, through which he ſendeth forth Spirit to enlighten, and convince; and to bring the convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to believe, and the believer to partake of eternall life, in which reſpect the Goſpell is a light, and a judge. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12.46, 47, 48, 49.50.</p>
               <p>He ſaid, I have not ſpoken of my ſelfe, but the Father which ſent mee, hee gave mee a commandement what I ſhould ſay, and what I ſhould ſpeake, and I know that his commandment is life everlaſting, whatſoever I ſpake there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, even as the Father ſaid unto mee, ſoe I ſpeake, and ſo he ſaith; The Lord God hath given mee the toung of the learned, that I ſhould know how to miniſter a word in due ſeaſon, to him that is weary, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.4.</p>
               <p>In reſpect of theſe commands put on Chriſt, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to bee performed by him, hee is in generall called, The Saviour of the world. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.42. And Gods ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the ends of the earth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.6. And in ſpeciall the Saviour of his Body, his people, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.23. <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.21. And hence alſo hee is ſaid to be created for the glory of God; and bidden by God, to bring forth the blind people that have eyes, and the deafe that have eares, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.6, 7. and 43.7.8. And becauſe hee undertooke, and went on in theſe commandements, by the will, and apointment of the Father, hee is ſaid to enter in the performance of both by the doore, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.1, 2, 3.17, 18. So that by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:60076:35"/>own teſtimony it apeares, what the Fathers commands concerning him were.</p>
               <p n="3">III. It farther apeares by the furniture, wherewith hee was fitted to keepe theſe commands, and ſo to perform both parts of his Fathers will, in effecting ſalvation for the world, and eternall ſalvation in his peculiar people; the Scriptures <hi>Aſſirming.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">I. That for the firſt, Hee was ſent into the world to bee the Saviour of the world, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.14. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.17. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. And had a body given him, that was ſit to ſuffer, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.7. And was made under the law, <hi>Gall.</hi> 4.4.5. That ſoe hee might beare the ſinnes of men, and ſuffer, and offer up himſelfe in ſacrifice for them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19, 21.</p>
               <p n="2">II. That for the ſecond, hee was exalted at Gods right hand, and imeaſurably ſilled with the Holy Ghoſt, to ſend forth in the Goſpell, to make known the ſaluation wrought by his death, and in his owne body, and to aply the vertue of his bloud, and ſo to give repentance, and remiſſion of ſins, and ſo to heale, and ſave, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.4, 10, and 61, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 42, 1, 8. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.18, 20. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.31, 33, and 5, 31, 32. By which furniture, it appeares, what the commands to him were.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. It is yet farther manifeſt in that theſe commands ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to be peculiar too, and for Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, who is the Lord from heaven, a quickening Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.45.47. Theſe commands being ſuch as not only are but ever were, beyond the powre of all creatures, or any meere man to performe, <hi>Iob.</hi> 28.1.23. The law which God at firſt put in mans hart, and to which by the grace of creation he was bound with all the commands encluded in that law for loving God with all the hart, ſoul, and ſtrength, and ones neighbour as himſelf, were ſuitable, and fit for a living ſoule, as the firſt Adam was made, and might have beene kept by him, if he had abode in his integritie, and ſo ſin might have been kept from entring into the world, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.29. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.45. But to take away tranſgreſſion (when it is come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world) and to doe it by dying, and riſing againe, and ſo to ranſome, and work a redemption with God for tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors, this is, and alwayes was beyond the powre of any meere man to doe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.7.8. And ſo likewiſe to enlive theſe ranſomed ones lying dead in treſpaſſes, and ſins and to
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:60076:36"/>enlighten them, and give in the Holy Spirit to renew, and ſave them, and fill them with eternal life is beyond the powre of all creatures, or any meere man, though converted, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.13, and 3, 3, 5, 6, and 6, 44, 45. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.4.5.6.</p>
               <p>Theſe things are peculiar to him that is the ſon of God, God man, the ſaviour, and their is none beſides, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. and 2. to the end. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.21. Who had a body given him to ſuffer, and was manifeſted in this world to take away tranſgreſſions, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.5. And was exalted at his Fathers right hand, and filled with Spirit, to enlighten his ranſomed, to preach the Goſpell to the poore, to heale the broken harted, and bring his people to life, and glorie, <hi>ſa.</hi> 42.1, 8, and 50, 61, 1, 4. Whence God in putting theſe commands upon his owne ſon Jeſus Chriſt, and on him onlie, is ſaid to have laid help upon one that is mightie, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.19.</p>
               <p n="5">V. The ſtate, and condition wee were in whom he came to ſave, doth alſo evidence, theſe foremencioned, to be the commandments, that were given to Chriſt by him, that ſent him forth to be our ſaviour, our needs requiring the ſame, that he ſhould fulſill theſe commandments, for though his being righteous in fulfilling the law, to which by the grace of creation wee were all bound, was both needfull, and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for us, in that thereby, no need of any part of his ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, or ſacrifice for himſelf, but all for us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.26.27. Yet could not all that righteouſneſſe of his have made ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for our ſins, and overcome our death, and procured life for us, it he had not done this for us, by dying for our ſins, and riſing for our juſtification, and ſo fulfilled that command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.39. <hi>Gall.</hi> 2.21. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.25. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.18. Neither by all that his perſonall righteouſneſſe, joyned with the fulfilling of this command if he had not been filled with Spirit to ſend forth, and ſhould not by that Spirit in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell be fulfilling the other command, in teaching and rene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing us, applying that ſalvation wrought to us, and working ſalvation in us, could wee be eternally ſaved, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.1.8, and 61, 1, 4, and 54 3.11. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.44, 45, and 15, 1, 8. And thus it appeares, what the Fathers commandments concerning Chriſt are.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The ſecond thing to be enquired is, How, or in what manner Jeſus Chriſt kept his Fathers commandments, and that the Scripture ſhewes.</p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:60076:36"/>
               <p n="1">I. That he kept and performed the ſame in, and through an union with his Father in mind, will, and purpoſe, and ſo in love to his Father, and to his choſen, and to mankind. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.27.30. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.7, 9, 10. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.7.8. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.34. And ſo from the law writ in his hart, with delight to doe his will.</p>
               <p n="2">II. That hee ſo kept, and performed them in the midſt of a gain-ſaying people, and againſt many temptationes from the devill, and from the world, both Jewes, and Gentiles, and notwithſtanding many illrequitealls from his called ones, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.1, 2, 3, 4. and 65.2. <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.1.12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.3.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Hee ſo kept, and performed them conſtantly, goeing through, and enduring all the labour, payne, and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſet before him; till hee entred his reſt where hee abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth faithfull, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.5, 6. and 53.7. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2. and 4.10.16. <hi>Phill.</hi> 27.11.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. He kept, and performed them by the very powre of the devine nature, in and by the ſtirring, and motion of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.1, 14. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.4. and 6.4, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.1, 2.</p>
               <p>And thus, and in this manner did Jeſus keepe his Fathers commands; Secondly, For the things expreſſed, they are fully, and plainly affirmed, which ſhould bee to us proofe ſufficient; yet for better uſefulneſſe, wee may veiw them, that wee may the more profitably believe them.</p>
               <p n="1">I. The firſt of them is that Jeſus Chriſt hath kept his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers commands, not only thoſe that apertained to his own perſon, as hee had taken our nature, and had a ſoule, and body like us, and was made under the law for us, which law hee alſo perfectly kept, and fulfilled, and ſo in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect was altogether without ſin, and perfectly righteous, Which is greatly for our benefit, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.22. and 3.18. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.26.27. But alſo as that heere ſpecially ment, and which wee are heere eſpecially to heed, he hath kept thoſe commands which the Father gave him, in reſpect of his office and mediatorſhip, for which hee ſo fitted him, and which were ſo peculiar to him, and needfull for us, that hee ſhould performe, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4, 5, 6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.7.19. In reſpect whereof; hee is alſo the juſt one, and faithfull and perfectly righteous in fulfilling them, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.1.2.
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:60076:37"/>and 1.9. And that hee hath kept theſe commands, is evident.</p>
               <p n="1">I. By the plain affirmation of Scripture.</p>
               <p>In reſpect of the firſt command, that he gave himſelf a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome for all men, by the grace of God taſted death for every man, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9. Hee humbled himſelf, and became obedient to the death even the death of the croſſe, <hi>Phill.</hi> 2.8. Died for our ſins, and was buried, and roſe againe the third day according to the ſcriptures, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15, 3.4. In reſpect of the other command, a teſtimony in due time, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. Hee is the true light, which lighteth every man that commeth into the world, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.9. He taught in their ſinagogues, &amp;c. <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.14, 15, 22. He taught, and advocated for his diſciples, and gave his Fathers words to them, and ſent, and ſendeth forth Spirit from his Fathers right hand, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.33. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.7, 8, 12. And was, and is faithful to him that appointed him, as a ſon over his owne houſe, to edify preſerve conſolate, and glorify them <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.1, 6. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.1.4.</p>
               <p n="2">II. By his own teſtimonie, both by words, and deedes, by word, he ſaid, I will give my fleſh for the life of the world, I lay downe my life that I might take it againe, this commandment have I received, &amp;c. The Father gave mee a commandment, what I ſhould fay, and what I ſhould ſpeake therefore even as the Father ſaid unto mee, ſo I ſpeake, I have (ſaith hee to his Father) ſiniſhed the work which thou gaveſt mee to doe, I have manifeſted thy name unto the men whom thou gaveſt mee, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.51, and 10.17, and 12, 49.50, and 17, 4, 6. By deed, lie went out of the houſe, and over the brooke, and into the garden, and offered himſelf to thoſe that came to apprehended him, and died, and roſe, and aſcended, and ſent forth of the Holy Ghoſt, &amp;c. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.31, and 18, 1, 4, &amp;c. <hi>Act.</hi> 1, and 2.</p>
               <p n="3">III. By the teſtimony of his Father that Jeſus is his ſon, in and with whom hee is well-pleaſed, bidding all, to looke to him, and heare him, and aſſureth, that hee is full of Spirit, and will not faile in whatever appertaineth to him to doe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.17, and 17, 5. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.1.8.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. By the evidence, and witneſſe of the Holy Ghoſt, of whom it is ſaid, the Spirit of truth which proceedeth from the Father, hee ſhall teſtifie of mee, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.26. And ſo is the Holy Ghoſt a witneſſe of theſe things, whom God hath
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:60076:37"/>given to them that obey him, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.32. God alſo bearing witneſſe, with ſignes, and wonders, and divers miracles and gifts of the Holy Ghoſt according to his owne will, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.4. Yea the Holy Ghoſt will ſo evidence the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Chriſt in his perfect keeping of theſe commands, that he will reprove the world of ſin, becauſe they believed not on Chriſt (that had ranſomed them and received Spirit, and ſent forth light to bring them to believe) And he will enable ſuch as are turned in his reproofes to believe on Chriſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21.22. And will farther glorify Chriſt in the harts of believers, and guide them into all truth, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16.13.15. That they may know him in reſpect of his faithfulneſſe in theſe commands, to be all wiſedome, righteouſneſſe, ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and redemption for, and to them, an all life, and good in them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. <hi>Coll.</hi> 1.27, and 2, 3, 9, 10, and 3.11.</p>
               <p n="5">V. By the experiments of thoſe that are taught of God, who in the knowledge, and beliefe of this grace met with in Chriſt, his keeping theſe commands for us, have ſeene, and experimented, that through his obedience and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the firſt command, having offered himſelfe in ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, for the ſin of the world; It is that the earth is prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that life is reprived, that Gods patience, and long-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering is extended, and that mercies, and bownty are day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly renewed, and the foundation of repentance, laid, and the doore of hope, and life opened to them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 75.3. <hi>Act.</hi> 17.28. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16. <hi>With.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.22.23. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10.</p>
               <p>And that through his faithfulneſſe in the other command, making known and aplying by his Spirit the vertue of his bloud to them, and working by his Spirit in them it is, that they believe in him, and love him; that they enjoy remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins, peace with God, joye in the Holy Ghoſt, knowledge of their ſonſhip, ſupport in tryalls, refreſhing in ordinances, fellowſhip with God, and brethren, hope of glory, &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.24, 25. and 5.1, 11. <hi>Phill.</hi> 1.29. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21.22. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.17, 18. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.1, 2.3, 4, 7. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.8. &amp; 65.4.

               <p>And in his miniſtration of the Goſpell, and communication of Spirit, and all the opperationes thereof in the harts of his people, the Father is well-pleaſed with him, and as he hath accepted his ſacrifice, and ranſome for the ſons of men, ſo he accepteth all his Spirituall offerings, and opperationes in the harts of believers, acquainting them with, and drawing, and preſenting them before his Father, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.1.2.8. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 20.3. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.1, 8, and 5, 19, 37.

               <p n="4">IV.

The Goſpell declares Ieſus Chriſt to be the ſon of God, and ſaviour of the world, the head, hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, high-prieſt, Prophet and King of his church, <hi>Act,</hi> 2. 37. and 8, 37, and 9, 22. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.42. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.25. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. and 7. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.3.4.

And to condemne ſuch as refuſe, and rebell againſt him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.9.11. And in this declaration the Goſpell alſo declareth the intence love of God to mankind in the gift of his ſon, to be the ſaviour of the world, that whoſoever believeth in him might not periſh, but have everlaſting life, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.14. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.16.17. The well-pleaſedneſſe God hath taken in, and with his ſon, and that he hath done is, and doth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.17, and 17.5. The propitiation hee is for the ſins of the world, and the advocation he maketh for believers, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.29. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.1.2. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.24. The peculiar love of God to Chriſt, and to all thoſe that believe in Chriſt, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.20. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.13.19. And what Chriſt is to, and for them, and what he will work in them, and beſtow on them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.12, 16, and 6, 27. And all this is in the Goſpell, and by the miniſters thereof, and by the Spirit ſet forth as the foundation, and ground of the heavenly call, enviting to Chriſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.1.6. And whoſoever is by the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit enlightened to underſtand, and enabled to believe al this, with his hart, being convinced and drawne, thereby to Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.37, 42, and 6, 44, 45. <hi>Pro.</hi> 1.23. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.1.2.3. The Spirit doth farther enter the hart ſheading a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad this ſo great, and rich love of God therein, ſo as there doth from this grace naturally, and aptly ſpring up, in the thus believing hart from this grace believed. A beliefe and dependance on Jeſus Chriſt for eternall life, and all that appertaines thereto, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1, 5, 6, 10, 11. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.24.25. And alſo, an unfeyned love of our brother, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.21. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.22. From both which commands writ in the hart aptly ſprings up all contained in the particular precepts of the Goſpell, as is before ſhewne, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.13, and 7, 38, 39. And walking in this faith, and love, in minding the precepts, and veiw of the opportunities, the motiones, to go according to the mind of Chriſt will aptly ſpring up, ſo as one may go one ſerving in newneſſe of Spirit, and not in oldneſſe of letter, <hi>Pro.</hi> 6.20, 21, 22, 23. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.16, 17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.2, and 7, 6, 25, and 8, 1, 2. So that from this whole conſideration that the commands of Chriſt to his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, are ſuch commands as are contained, and expreſſed in the Goſpell, and put with the Goſpell by Chriſt into the hart of the believer, and do naturally, and aptly ſpring up,

Neither can any regenerate man avoid this by ſaying, perſonally in themſelves they have no ſin, or of themſelves, they do no ſin, but onely, as they are one with their brethren, and reckon themſelves after them ſo they are ſinners, and do ſin, while any of their brethren have ſin, and are found to ſin, for in ſuch a ſence even ſo might Jeſus Chriſt himſelf have ſaid, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53; 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5; 21. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2; 24.

               <p>Therefore, there is yet one thing more to be put in, in our keeping his commandements, namely, that as any ſin is yet found, either in our nature, or life, either againſt law of works, or law of grace, in failing either in faith, or

For God requires in this no more then hee hath ſowne, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.21.22. But in, and according to the Goſpell, accepts of believers the will for the deed, and requires noe more, but according to what they have, and accepteth that even ſoe of them, <hi>Mat.</hi>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:60076:49"/>10.40; 42; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8; 11; 12. But the cauſe of ſuch affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is</p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>Becauſe they have not abiden, and walked in faith, and love,</hi> Soe as by the grace made knowne, and received, they in remembring his gracious word, and exerciſing faith, and love, and yerlding to the Spirit therein, in denying fleſhly affectiones, and luſts, and ſoweing to the fruites and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones of the Spirit might have done, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78; 5, 11, 41, 42, and 81, 6, 12, and 106, 12, 15. <hi>Gall.</hi> 5; and 6, 8.</p>
               <p n="2">II. And becauſe moreover, when through forgetfulneſſe, and temptationes they are found ſo to have ſinned, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned aſide, they do not ſpeedily owne the ſame, and in ack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowledgement of the grace of Chriſt, and their owne ill-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiteals, turne to him, confeſſing their ſins, and judging themſelves, and ſeeking remiſſion, and healing from God through Chriſt, and ſo not judging themſelves, they are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven therefore judged of the Lord in this world, that they may not be condemned with the world, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1; 7, 9, and 2, 1. <hi>Ier.</hi> 6; 15. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12; 20, 21. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11; 31, 32. And theſe two cauſes, meeting in one are the very cauſe of all ſmarting correctiones, which are not uſually laid on any, til both theſe meete, unleſſe in the firſt, there be wil fulneſſe, and preſumption, and then it containes both in one, as in Davids caſe, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19; 12, 13, and 32, 3, 4, and 33. And yet on harty confeſſion, and turning, much releaſe then alſo, and yet in all this I limmit not the Holy one, but ſhew what he hath declared to bee his uſuall way, as for Iobs tryall, it was an unuſual thing, and ſo ſuch a probation, as God never excerciſeth his with, but when he minds to give a double bleſſing in the iſſue, <hi>ſee Iob firſt and laſt,</hi> all which agree well with the promiſe heere, and al that is ſaid before as the ground of this.</p>

               <p>And this alſo may be a hint of helpfulneſſe for diſcerning, and differenting the motiones of the Spirit of bondage, from the motiones of the Spirit of grace, and adoption.</p>
               <p n="1">I. The Spirit of bondage hath its law, and force in, and from the law of works, and ſoe affords no hope, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to a mans conformity too; and obſervance of the law of works, under which a man was firſt borne, and ſo dictates
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:60076:49"/>to a man, and moves with, this I ought, and that I ought to do, according to that law, and leaves a man to his owne underſtanding and ſtrength, to ſtrive after it, without any inward living principle from any devine powre, ſpringing up the motion, and free, and living motion, ſtreaming, with inclination thereto, but only a humane motion, leaving, in all that is done, to the trial, cenſure, and accuſation of the law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2; 14, 15, and 3, 20, and 7, 1, 6, 23, 24, 25, and 8, 1, 2, 15. <hi>Gall.</hi> 3.10, and 5, 18.</p>
               <p n="2">II.

And ſo though the believers looking about them may ſay, this wee ought, and that wee ought to beliefe, and do according to the Goſpel, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4; 10, 11. Yet the Spirit of grace dictates, and moves, with a certaine devine powre in the new man, and ſo ſprings up the motion from a living principle with in through the beliefe of the grace in Chriſt, and the love of Chriſt and brethren, ſtreaming with a living; and ſtirring motion, and inclination to that is good, and well-pleaſing in the ſight of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4; 21, 24. <hi>Coll.</hi> 3; 10, 12. <hi>Gall.</hi> 2; 20. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5; 6, 11, 14, 20. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12; 1, 2.

               <p>And this may be an exhortation, and motive, to ſtir us up to give up our ſelves, as thoſe that are alive to God, with all readineſſe, diligence, and reſoluteneſſe, through the beliefe of the grace of Chriſt, to keepe theſe his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments alwayes, ſeeing as hath beene ſhewne, and the words beare forth.</p>
               <p n="1">I. It is the mind, and will of Chriſt that hath ſo loved us, and performed ſuch commandements for us, in which hee hath bought us, and is become ours, and wee his, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20. <hi>Gall.</hi> 2.20.</p>

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:60076:50"/>to his diſciples, that ſo keeping his commandements, they ſhall abide in his love, &amp;c. A gracious, comfortable, and large promiſe, which that wee may the better underſtand it there are fowre things to be heeded about it.</p>
               <p n="1">I. What that is to which the promiſe is made to belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</p>
               <p n="2">II. On what, or whome the performance of the promiſe depends.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Who, and what a one hee is that hath ſo promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. What the promiſe it ſelf is, and what it contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</p>
               <p n="1">I. For the firſt: that to, and according to which the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is made is the keeping of Chriſt his commandements in truth, and uprightneſſe, according to the grace given, and which wee have received of him, for ſo are his words, <hi>If yea keepe my commandements, yea ſhall abide in my love, even as I have kept my Fathers commandements, and abide in his love,</hi> Theſe words even as appeare to point out the aſſurance, and the example and the ſimilitude, to which our keeping muſt be comformed, but not tying our keeping to that degree of perfection that was in his keeping there is a perfection of truth, and parts, which as it was in his keeping, ſo it is required in ours, and that is ſet downe before, and this is the ſimilitude, and likeneſſe pointed out in the words. <hi>Even as</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But as for perſection of degree, that was peculiar to him, and his keeping the commandements, as is a little before ſhewne, and this not ſo impoſed heere.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Beſides:</hi> Hee hath appointed meanes for thoſe to whom this promiſe is made; both to grow one to more fruitfulneſſe, and toward perfection, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15; 1, 8. And helps, to get re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery in failings, to riſe againe, and proceed to the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this promiſe, which he would not have done, if the promiſe had beene only to perfection of degree in the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his commandements, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1; 3, 4, 7, 9, and 2, 1, 2.</p>
               <p>More-over, he ſpakes not this to feare them, or put them to a maze as it would have beene, if he had tyed his promiſe to the perfection of degree in the keeping his commands, but he expreſly ſaith, he ſpake this that his joy might bee in them, and that their joy might be full. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.11. And
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:60076:51"/>elſe where it is ſaid, if there be firſt a willing mind it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted according to what a man hath, and this both in the endeavours, and fruites, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9; 12. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10; 40, 41, 42.</p>
               <p>So that it is the truth, and manner of keeping according to grace received, too, and according to which the promiſe is made, ſo that the weakeſt believer ſo giving himſelf to walk in faith, and love as a foreſaid, may have this conſolation, and looke for this promiſe, <hi>Gall.</hi> 5.5.</p>
               <p n="2">II. For the ſecond, upon whom the performance of this conſolation, and promiſe dependeth, and that is on himſelf, and the faithfulneſſe, and powre of him that hath promiſed, <hi>yea ſhall abide in my love,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſs.</hi> 5.24. Who hath enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged himſelf to preſerve them, and worke all their works for them, and give life to them, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6; 40, and 14, 19. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.12. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 138.8. So as they may depend on him, both to enable them to keepe his commandements, and alſo to make good this promiſe to them, and be diſappointed in neit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.6. And this is very comfortable to the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſt believers, walking in faith, and love.</p>
               <p n="3">III. For the third thing, who, and what a one hee is, that hath ſo promiſed, that is Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God, <hi>Chap.</hi> 14.9. and 15, 1. I have loved you, and yea ſhall abide in my love; This is hee, who is the mighty God, and the truth it ſelfe; that is one in the Father, and the Father in him, who ſo loved us, that he came down from Heaven, and tooke our nature, and bare our ſins, and curſe, and offered himſelf in ſacrifice to God to worke redemption, and ſalvation for us, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.13, 14. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14; 6, 10. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. and 3; 18. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. And aſcended to heaven, and received Spirit to apeare in Heaven for us, and ſent forth Spirit to us to worke ſalvation in us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9; 24. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.18, 21. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4; 7, 16. Unto whom the Father hath given all powre, and authority, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8; 1. Who is full of love to us, and faithfulneſſe for us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.1.6. <hi>So as we may ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſely depend on him for this promiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">IV. For the fourth thing; What the promiſe it ſelfe is, and what it containes; the promiſe it ſelfe is, <hi>Yea ſhall abide in my love; if yea keepe my commandements, yea ſhall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Fathers commands, and abide in his love.</hi> So that the cauſing us to abide in his love, is the promiſe: And it contaynes three things clearly.</p>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:60076:51"/>
               <p n="1">I. The having us in his peculiar love, not only to love us, but to love us with peculiar, and choyſe love, ſurely, forbearing to ſmite us, and to ceaſe from all his wrath to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſuch unworthy ones, as wee were, <hi>Great favour,</hi> and our demeanour well conſiderd; reaſon might ſay, as much as were meete for us to aske of him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85, 3, 4, 5. But to ſhew forth his compaſſionate love in the redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wrought for mankind, and there-through to bring in to receive romiſſion of ſins, what abundant grace and favour is this, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.43. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3; 4, 5. But to love us with ſuch peculiar, and delightfull love, as the Father loveth him, this is more abundant, but to have us ſo in that choyſe love of his, as to compaſſe us with it, that we ſhould be in his boſome, and as the ſeale in his hart, in all his choyſe, delight, will, and purpoſes, and as the ſeale on his arme, in all his choyſe workings, and all for good to us; Oh what hart can deſire more, or be able to deſire ſo much, <hi>Can.</hi> 8.6, 7, 9. It exeedes the deſires of the hart; <hi>And yet is this contained in this promiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. The abiding in this love, ſurely one dayes enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this love were better then a thouſand dayes enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all the loves, and contentments this world can afford, yea the deprivation of all theſe loves and contents a thouſand dayes might befully ſatisfied for with one dayes enjoyment of this his peculiar love, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84; 6, 10. Yea ſurely a ſight, and taſt heerof will take, and raviſh with ſweetneſſe the ſoule that ſeeth, and taſteth this peculiar love, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.18, 19, 20. <hi>Cant.</hi> 1; 2, 3. But to dwell, and abide, and have ones habitation in it, who can expreſſe it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91; 1, 2, &amp;c. Or be able with the eye of his hart unleſſe much ſtreng-thened by the Holy Ghoſt to veiw it, yea even then alſo it will be veiwed incomprehenſible, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1; 17, 20, and 3, 14, 19.</p>
               <p>And yet is this the love contained in this promiſe.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The flowing and encreaſing of this love upon us, and the encreaſing of ſtrength in us to veiw, and enjoy it more, and more, till wee come to the harveſt and fulneſſe of it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84; 7, 11, 12. If the firſt fruites be ſo ſweere, what is the harveſt, if a glimpſe overcame Peter, that it made him forget, wife children, friends, and all earthy contents, and himſelf, for all other loves, and farther favours, that he would have choſen to have dwelt in that, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17; 3, 4. If
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:60076:52"/>a taſt ſo ſweet and ſatisfying; Oh what is it then to be oft vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited with it, and the manifeſtationes of it, and to be cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and filled with it to cate, and drink it, and to feed, and be feed, and feaſted with it yea glorified in, and with it for ever, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14; 21, 23. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3; 2. And yet all this is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in this promiſe, <hi>Yea ſhall abide in my love, as I abide in my Fathers love;</hi> And ſo my Father loveth you, as hee loveth mee, and I love, as my Father loveth mee, my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and joy in you, and your joy full.</p>
               <p>Oh how comfortable, ſweete, large, and ſure is this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and how graciouſly ordered for our conſolation, if it had beene made to the perfection of degree, in our keeping of his commandements, wee might have feared our never enjoyment, but being to the truth, and manner of keeping, for which grace is already given us, and he will never be wanting, it is exceeding comfortable for us.</p>
               <p>If the performance of this promiſe had depended on our ſtrength, and faithfulneſſe, wee might have beene in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall doubt of failing, and miſſing it, but he having provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded help for our weakneſſe, and put the performance upon his owne powre, truth, and faithfulneſſe, there is no cauſe of doubt in him.</p>
               <p>If according to his work in old time, he had only ſent this promiſe to us by ſome of his ſervants, it ought to have been believed, but yet in ſome temptation, wee might happily have doubted, and ſaid in haſt al men are liars, but comming forth of his owne mouth, who can doubt the truth of it, if it had been but of his general, and compaſſionate love, wee might have feared want of fulneſſe, or our dropping out of it, but being of his peculiar love, and ſuch, and ſo ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting love, what more ſafe, or what can be more deſired, <hi>the promiſe is thereſore very precious, and comfortable.</hi>

               <p n="1">I. The keeping of the word of grace put in the hart, and believed through which theſe commands of faith in Chriſt, and love of brethren were begotten, and whence they ſpring, beeing through the miniſtration of the Goſpell, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration of the almighty written in the hart; this word re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, loved, and delighted in, and ſo tyed to the hart, and ſubmitted too, and ſo tyed about the neck, great the promiſe theretoo. For is it not ſaid of this word, it ſhall lead us when wee goe, (it ſhall ſhew us our way, and give us ſtrength to guide us) and when ſlumbering befalls us, that wee ſleepe, or are eaſed of cares in caſting our cares on God, about our own ſafety; It ſhall watch for us, and keepe us, and ſhall bee a light to us, and inſtruction in the way of life to keepe us from evill, <hi>Pro.</hi> 6.20, 21, 22, 23, 24. That it is able to ſave our ſoules (from falling through ignorance, unbeliefe, pride, vaine glory, covetouſneſſe, uncleanneſſe, and from the evil of the temptationes of the fleſh, devill, or world, and wee ſhal be bleſſed in our deed, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15; 1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.21, 23.

               <p n="5">V. Yea even all the fruites of faith, and love in every particular ſervice thereof have promiſe of acceptance, and bleſſing, and anſwer of prayers, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.10. <hi>Gall.</hi> 6.8. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.22.23.24.</p>

               <p>So that if the love of God, and Chriſt, towards us bee of any force with us, and deſired of us. let it be a load ſtone to us, and have its perfect work with us, to give up all our members to God, in keeping theſe commandements of Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1.2.3. <hi>Phill.</hi> 2.1.2.3.4.5.6.
